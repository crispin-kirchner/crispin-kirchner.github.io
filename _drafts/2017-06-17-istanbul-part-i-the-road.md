This article is part two in the trilogy of long anticipated events. While the last article described the crossing into a new culture, in this article I will reach Istanbul. The next article will complete the series by dealing with the first time I left Europe. But let's go back to where we last stopped: Edirne, right after the Turkish border.

# The Edirne Sequel

We had a quick breakfast in the morning and then went to have another look at Edirne when there was daylight, planning to go cycling again after lunch. I wanted to go see the bridge we had seen when cycling into Edirne from closer. In fact it was two bridges, spanning two arms of the same river. Both are built in the same fashion, one shorter, one longer. The one we had seen from far was the longer one. They are quite narrow, such that two cars can pass by each other, but only if the pedestrians evade onto one of the narrow sidewalks.

As Maik's handlebar was quite low, and he was therefore getting lots of strain on his wrists, we were also trying to find an extension to his fork's tube, such that the handlebar would be higher. We had seen this on the bike of the German cyclist coming from China, who we had met in Sofia. On the way back we stopped at a shop selling used bicycles and parts. He didn't have something like that, but called a different store in Edirne for us, where we would find such a part. Fortunately it was on our way out of the city, so we went back to the hostel, wrote some postcards, had lunch and then headed out of the city.

The store was run by bicycle enthusiasts, and they had more than one fork extension to choose from. We spent quite some time there, talking to the owner while Maik's fork was getting the extension fitted. He told us that the shop itself had a WarmShowers profile and offered us to stay another night; which we declined as we wanted to continue. While we stood there and talked, other touring cyclists approached the shop. They were three French people, a couple and a solo cyclist. I had already heard rumors about the couple from other touring cyclists in Serbia: they went on a tandem, where the front position was like on a recumbent bike, while the rear position was normal sitting. They were really nice, we chatted all together, about our trips, how we came. They even gave Maik and me a test ride on the front position of the tandem. It was a rare gathering, five touring cyclists in one place had never happened before so far.

There were some difficulties with the repair, and because the shop people were nice they also greased Maik's brake strings -- in the end everything took quite a while. So when we were getting ready to leave again, it was already 4pm. We shortly considered cycling two hours and camping somewhere against staying and having a longer break; the decision was easy. As I had programmed most of the night before at the hostel, I was completely done and very tired, so we asked whether we could stay for the night. We were led into an apartment that seemed to serve three purposes: living, hosting touring cyclists and as a shop warehouse. The numerous guests had all left messages on the kitchen tiles.

I slept well that night, although I was a little bit scared that the wall of bicycles next to my mattress might fall over during the night. But fortunately nothing happened.

The next morning, we had a tea with our host in the shop (they had started as a cycling café and then started the shop), and he was very eager to get us places to sleep at for the next two nights. So before we left, he had already organized us something to sleep in Lüleburgaz, and recognized us a WarmShowers host for the day after that. We left, very grateful.

# The Road to Istanbul

On the D100

That day we did not take a nice route over the villages as before, but decided to go for the fast lane: the D100. We did this to check out how it was to ride on the D roads in Turkey, but also because Maik's setup had changed, it was reasonable to go for an easy and short route that day. In spite of the traffic, the roads are a nice way to go, as there is a wide hard shoulder one can ride safely on. I felt it was a little bit frustrating to have such a monotonous route; the landscape was only changing slowly and the road kept going up and down always in the same fashion, and very exhausting on the long run.

When we stopped at a supermarket, we experience the Turkish hospitality once again: Without further comment, a man delivering goods to the supermarket gave a package of ice cream to Maik.

Our host in Edirne had given us the address of a shop in Lüleburgaz where we should go in order get accommodation. Arriving there, we were surprised to see that it was not another bicycle shop, but rather a shop selling a little bit of everything. All we had to do was stand in front of it, some moments later we were greeted with "Welcome! Do you want to sleep in Lüleburgaz?" After affirming, the guy got his bicycle and rode us through the city to the "Academy" -- a course for learning to ride a bicycle, with hills, bumps and different curves.

He talked to the guard, and some phone calls later we were showed a room which was obviously built for the exact purpose of hosting touring cyclists. The room had four wooden boxes as furniture, which served as a bed when one put a sleeping mat on top. And there were multiple showers! On the downside, the building was very modern architecture -- it was not possible to open windows, therefore the air was quite stuffy. I only found out the next morning that the air conditioning could also have been used to ventilate the place with fresh (outside) air.

After moving in and showering, we went for a walk through the city and ended up in a café where there was WiFi. Now that my ticket *into* Iran was glued into my passport, I had started thinking about the outward ticket as well. As I have not flown much in my life so far, never long distances, and also not with a bicycle, it was comforting to have Maik sitting next to me. He had flown a lot and I could clear most doubts by quickly asking. That way I booked a flight on the end of August, with an Iranian airline. As the baggage allowance is ridiculously high (30kg and 1.58m), I am quite confident that I will take the bicycle back home with me. The price was good, and most important it's a direct flight from Tehran to Munich -- no stopovers which would increase my anxiety about my luggage. In the evening I also started writing to shared flats in my future home, Berne.

For navigating, we had lately used Maik's navigation software. It took long to compute the route, but in the end it led us mostly over nicely cyclable roads with few traffic. After the experience of the D100 the day before, we decided to go back to this more pleasant cycling mode. In one village we were treated with exceptional hospitality. We stopped there to have lunch. First, the owner of the supermarket gave each of us a lemonade for free. When we sat on the ground in front of a closed restaurant, a man came along and opened up for us, such that we could sit at tables. Shortly afterwards, a German came round to pay us a visit. He had lived in Germany since 1970 and just two years ago had come back to Turkey, where he was born. His son is the mayor of a village close to Stuttgart. He invited us for tea in the café on the opposite side of the road. I declined because I was having stomach problems and suspected that they were related to the unusual amounts of black tea I had been consuming since we had entered Turkey. Maik went with him, while I used the break for writing on the blog. When I looked up a little bit later, I was somewhat discomforted to see that Maik was suddenly nowhere to be seen -- he was no longer in the café. But shortly later, he reappeared. He related to me how the man had taken him to his home, introduced the whole family (including the son-mayor!). Maik had had to drink even more tea, and was shown the crops that the family grew by themselves.

On the road again, it happened ever more often that the route computation of Maik crashed. All along, I started missing my "old" way of navigating, using the compass without really knowing where I was going. I had started to think about separating from Maik after we would have reached Istanbul, to get back my independence and get rid of being the one trailing behind. When we later took a wrong turn, Maik told me something about a "detour of 50km" and seemed to think about going back to the place where we had missed a turn. The word "detour" sort of flicked a switch inside me -- my philosophy of being on the road had always been to just enjoy, and to not believe in detours, as each meter of the road had proven to be valuable so far. Furthermore, the junction where we were standing had a road going perfectly east; just where we wanted to go. Fed up with discussing about where we went next, I decided that this was the road I would have taken if I would have been alone, and left Maik standing there. When he caught up again, we had a short exchange of our main concerns. As I knew, Maik wanted to be in Georgia in the middle of July, while I just wanted to travel by bike, without too many fixed time frames. Especially, it did not make sense for me to be in Iran too early, as this would mean the hassle of organizing a visa extension. Long story short, we agreed that our traveling styles did not match well on the long run. Funny enough, Maik told me that he had been thinking about splitting up after Istanbul -- same as me. With this new goal in mind, it was easier for me to accept the way we were navigating, and I was determined to fully enjoy the coming last days with Maik.

* * *

The day we wanted to reach Istanbul, we had an ambitious goal: it's 140km to the city center. At the next possible location, we checked for news about the WarmShowers requests I had been sending -- with the disappointing but somewhat expected result that we only got half an accepted request, which is as good as none. I then frantically started writing requests, in the hope of still getting something. When we checked later on again, the situation had not changed, so we went for the habitual option: Maik booked a hostel. I still had to celebrate something: my favorite shared flat in Berne had accepted to have a phone call with me. A long while later, when we had hit the 100km mark, we arrived in the periphery of Istanbul. Maik was wondering whether there would be public transport to carry us into the city, but I was determined to go by bicycle -- I had gone so many kilometers by bicycle and was not willing to break with the principle of only cycling on my journey. Mustering our last strength and courage, we set off to take on the last part of that day's trip. It's not long before we find ourselves on the outermost lane of a heavily trafficked road with three lanes, and realize that we have to get to the leftmost. a little bit later, Maik's navigation repeatedly crashed and we started using my app for navigation. I am not keen on doing this, because the voice guidance is pretty bad and had already often misled me. However, as Maik had no voice guidance at all, it seemed like the most reasonable approach, so I stuck in my earphones and went first. A little bit later, the periphery suddenly ended again and we were on a dirt road out in the open fields -- it had just been another disconnected suburb.

When the road made a sharp bend to the right, my navigation told me to go left. At the same time, a turk started to talk something to us, naturally we didn't understand, but the essence was that he agreed with my navigation software -- going right led nowhere. The bad thing was that going left did not lead anywhere much either.

> ![The path to doom (i.e. the railway)](/images/IMG_2965.JPG)
The path to doom (i.e. the railway)

The narrow bad path full of rubble led steep down into a railway course, with about three meters of height difference. The Sofia experience was about to be repeated. We were equally exhausted and saw no way of getting our bikes down there, not talking about getting them up again. Fortunately, there was this heaven sent guardian angel who helped us with all of this -- without him, our trip would have been extended by another 10km at least, which would have been fatal.

After this adventure, we were back on a main road again, which would bring us to the city center from now. Often times we had to cross multiple lanes or go straight where many were leaving the highway. It was heavy traffic, and putting much stress on us, but overall, it was feasible. The cars were many, and it was madening to keep them all in sight, but the drivers were paying attention as well. In fact they were so cautious with us that the only dangerous situation ended in a car taking damage, but leaving me unharmed: At one of the many off-ramps where we were continuing straight while the cars exited on the right, a driver tried to exit after having overtaken me. He kept a huge distance to me and was obviously more concerned with keeping me from harm than with where he was driving: When he was about to go into the greenery he hit the brakes really hard, leaving two stripes of black on the concrete, but it was too late. The car front hit the stones at the border of the greenery, while the car wet over it. To my astonishment the driver did not care enough to even stop -- he just went over the greenery and joined the traffic on the off-ramp that way.

When it started getting dark, we each got two vegetarian Çiǧköfte as a dinner, eating one straight away and then continuing. The navigation then led us into a dark side alley, where I lost orientation, as the reality was no longer ***übereinstimmen*** with what the map showed. In addition, I did not feel safe going into this empty side street, nor did Maik. He soon got me to return to the lightened main road again, which was definitely a good decision. I might have been the one following the route and leading us, but in our exhausted state we definitely needed both our brains to survive. Later on I once again needed Maik's help in order to find the way to the on-ramp of the next road we were about to take. With time, the traffic was becoming slower and the sidewalks more lively. The only ones still taking our right of way were the taxi drivers, but I had long ago started to follow Maik's example of yelling at them when they did it. They still took our right of way, but the yelling was very pleasant, as it gave relief to the mental strain I was feeling.

Following the road, we were suddenly at the coordinates of the hostel, which was the biggest relief of all. It was 11pm, and we had successfully fought our way into the heart of this ***20 million*** beast! Naturally the journey was not over: There was no hostel to be seen. But the locals were wary: a guy sitting in front of a hotel asked us if we were in search of the hostel, and then called someone to guide us there. A minute later, a guy appeared. We expected to go round the corner, but things turned out differently. Our guide was going on a quite long walk with us, down multiple streets and away from the noisy, lively part of the city -- the whole thing felt quite fishy. We kept asking where he was guiding us, suspecting to lose at lest one kidney each in this. We arrived at a residential building, were shown the code to the front door, with no satisfying explanation why the hostel was at a different location than it said on the website. I have not seen the movie "Hostel", and I am grateful that I haven't, and in that moment I think it was a lifesaver, I guess I would have panicked completely. Maik stayed with the bikes, I went up to the "hostel" (a.k.a. apartment) with the guy, keeping my pepper spray at hand. In the end, all turned out well: they just had that additional apartment for the case that the hostel was over-booked, we saw the next day that this second hostel was even on Google Maps -- so in the end everything was fine.

# Istanbul

Some time ago, in 2015, when I was all caught up in university stress, I was looking for ways to drive my thoughts away from how behind I was with my studies. I came up with imaginary hitch-hiking: I asked myself the question: "If you went hitch-hiking tomorrow, where would you go?" The answer to that question represented the need to get away as far as possible from my current situation: I chose Istanbul. To be ready at any time to go there, I wrote the name of the city on a big piece of cardboard and hung it to my wall, also to remember myself that there was more to life than studying. Naturally, the sign was never used, but it laid the foundation for my desire to go there one time. It represented the dream of seeing big, ancient buildings topped with domes and surrounded by minarets, overlooking a vast city with lots of water.

That said, Istanbul was another important checkpoint on my journey. While going into the city the night before, all I had seen were some colorful lights, traffic and pedestrians moving in the semi-darkness of the megacity. Now in the morning w went over to the main part of the hostel to have breakfast. It was located on the uppermost two floors of a high old building, in Istanbul's old town, with a narrow winding staircase leading up there. Going up there this morning, still feeling the strain of the last long day of cycling in my legs, I was very happy that we had had a shorter way up with all our luggage in the second part of the hostel. The efforts were rewarded, however: the breakfast was served in a cozy dining room with a terrace and an outlook over the old town, the dome of the blue mosque so close that it felt like it was possible to just reach out to touch it.

After breakfast, we went for a walk through the city. We did not get far until we came across the French couple with the recumbent tandem, who were also staying in a hostel in the old town. They were staying in Istanbul for applying for their Iran visa and were having a week of waiting ahead of them, as they just now ha applied for the reference code. We exchanged our experiences in getting into the city. They told us about a hint they had got from another cyclist to evade the murderous traffic at least on the way out: taking a ferry straight from the oldtown to the south shore of the Marmaran sea. I desperately wanted to cycle over the Bosphorus bridge however, so I was only listening half-hearted. They also showed us pictures of their last campspot: Right at the shore of the Marmaran sea. Maik and me had avoided going there, as the map indicated that the shoreline was completely built up with hotels and the like.

We then started our city tour by walking through the Gülhane Park, then continued to the edge of the oldtown peninsula, to enjoy the magnificent view over the Bosphorus. The water color was of a magnificent blue, and I couldn't resist the temptation to roll up my trousers a bit and step into the refreshing, ankle-deep water. However, I hadn't payed enough attention, for a boat had just passed by -- seconds later my trousers were wet up to the thighs.

Next, we went over a bridge and up the hill of the Beyoǧlu district. At the foot of the hill there was a store for outdoor gear, and I got a new threaded gas canister. Halfway up we took a break in a café, which had artfully crafted radiators. We had a look at the Galata tower from close by and continued to the Taksim square.

For the way back to the old town, we took the metro and exited at the university. From there, we started our search for Baklava. Our appetite was huge as always, so we first got some packed Baklava, but when we came across a café where the prices for it were also moderate, we did not hesitate to go in there as well.

Baklava

Maik is in posession of a steel mug, which he can use on his cooker to make a cup of coffee in the morning. As I wanted to have a similar comfort for making tea, we also set out to find such a mug. We tried the Grand Bazaar. In principle it seemed to me like the predecessor of today's malls. It is a cavernous maze of many narrow alleys lined with small shops, only in a historical building. What's also interesting about the building is that the floor is not leveled, but follows the ups an downs of the hill on which it is built. Same as in the metro, there were safety checks at the entrances. However they did not seem effective to me, as the gas canister I was carrying with me was ignored all the time. I didn't have to open the bag even once, although I was carrying a metal canister with explosive gas in it. The shops inside the bazaar seemed to be specialized entirely on tourists, something plain useful like a steel mug was not to be found.

> ![The Grand Bazaar](/images/IMG_2992.JPG)
The Grand Bazaar

Leaving the bazaar, we witnessed a scary sight: all shops around us were closed, the alleys deserted. It was Saturday, and we were suddenly worried that we would fail to get more to eat for the rest of the day than the packs of Baklava we were carrying. Heading towards the Blue Mosque our worries were dispersed at once, however: some streets further down, we were all of a sudden in a street completely packed with people, and with all shops open to the left end right.

> ![Sudden crowd](/images/IMG_2996.JPG)
Sudden crowd

We got an inanely expensive (meaning ordinary German prices) Pide for dinner. The diner in which we got them was exceptional, however: they had opened a hole in the floor leading down to the basement without putting up any "watch out!" signs. For ordering, Maik stepped right next to the hole -- it was just sheer luck that he did not fall in, but we laughed it away together with the employees, who had tried before to cautiously draw our attention to the hole, such that we would not make rash movements next to it.

> ![Hole in the floor](/images/IMG_2997.JPG)
Hole in the floor

After the pide we continued to the Blue Mosque, whose proper name is *Sultan Ahmed Mosque*. As Maik had announced before, it carried lots of similarities to the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, but was smaller. Especially the Minarets seemed clinched in comparison. In the interior it was evident that this mosque was better being taken care of than the less famous in Edirne. However, the ambient could not compare at all. The mosque was full of chattering tourists. As visitors were asked to carry their shoes with them in plastic bags, the rustling of these was as omnipresent as the constant noise of hundreds of voices. There was a division of where believers and where tourists were supposed to be, but the concept was not effective, as the great majority of visitors seemed to be believers who were tourists at the same time, with only a small number of people actually praying and a vanishingly low number of people seeming to respect this. No, the Blue Mosque did not succeed in radiating the holy dignity of it's relative in Edirne.

Entering Sinop, my tire was losing air slowly; I had to pump two times in the vicinity of Sinop. I entered using the western highway. When I arrived at the merging of the southern highway, I glimpsed a rare sight: another touring biker was just coming from the southern part. I started yelling to catch his attention, but of course to no avail, so I mustered all my remaining strengths to increase speed and catch up with him. When I finally did, I realized that e was Turkish, so we couldn't even talk; but he made some gestures signaling that there was someone else who could speak English. A little bit further on the road, there were two more touring bikes. The other two were brothers from Iran who were doing a bicycle roundtrip through Turkey; they were on the way to Istanbul and would then head to the Mediterranean coast. While we talked, Asım, my CouchSurfing host for the net two nights, joined us; as the cyclist meetup did not happen far from the meeting point we had arranged.

I went with Asım to his home, where I could unload my luggage and park my bike. On the way, Asım told me that he had friends around and that we would spend most of the time together. After a short shower we went down to the beach to meet with the other three, Enes, Abo and Mehmet. The ground of the sea was very flat at the beach, and we had to walk for some 100 meters to actually swim. If we just had continued swimming for a long time, we would have ended up in Crimea.

For enjoying the sunset, we went to a place east of Sinop, where the sea cuts into the mainland. I was told that in some distant past, the Turkish (or rather Osman) fleet had used this as a hiding place, to surprise the Russian fleet, which was marching on the Osman empire. Using this maneuver, they destroyed the Russian fleet. Back at home, Enes and Asım cooked like their moms for us; we had a three-course dinner. The starter was a lentil soup that according to the guys was ***misslungen**, though I still liked it. As always in Turkey, the dessert was *karpuz*; watermelon. As an ***Absacker***, we also finished the [Rakija]() [which I had gotten in Serbia](). I enjoyed being with the boys a lot, it had been a wonderful day. I didn't know though that they had already planned for a similarly nice second half of my stay.

Contradicting my own prediction that I would be awake by eight, I slept very long and well the next morning, after half past ten. Asım and Enes again prepared breakfast like their moms; they were not wasting any opportunity for me to learn a bit about Turkish culture. We had scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers, and loads of different things to put on bread. Apart from the expected (cheese, meat, honey, ***Nutella***), there were also olives and fried eggplant, which we ate with ***joghurt***. After I fixed my rear tire, which had recently ***Probleme machen***, we got in the car to drive to the *waterfalls*. The drive was quite long and fun, for we sung together. Arriving, it became obvious that we were not the only ones to visit this scenic site; there was a vast number of picnic spots, all packed with families having barbecue around the marvelous lower end of the waterfall. Luckily, one could go up the waterfalls, as there were many, and we were soon out of the noisy, packed environment and in nature.

It was very hot that day, and I was looking forward to bathing in the cool water, as we had planned. We finally arrived at a waterfall that was not too easily accessible and therefore gave us some privacy. When I proposed to go swimming, the boys argued that they had left their swimming trunks in the car. I convinced them to still go in there, by saying that I didn't even have swimming trunks with me on the tour.

For dinner we had ***Kebab***. From a German perspective, this might not seem too exciting, as Kebab is sort of the  typical Turkish dish in Germany, but there were two aspects that made it an ***erlebnis***: first, we had it on the outermost part of the Sinop peninsula, overlooking the city. Second: the Turkish ***Kebab*** was nothing like the German version. The only common elements were the meat and that it was rolled up in a flat dough. Whereas in Germany the ***Kebab*** is packed with different vegetables, cabbage and salad, the Turkish one contained mainly parsley, tomatoes and most surprising: potatoes. Instead of adding a spicy power, each of us got a tiny ***zip-lock*** bag with small green hot peppers; whenever I preferred to have a more spicy bite, I stuck one of these into the dough roll.

In the evening I copied over the music the guys had in the car, such that I will be able to sing along next time we meet. The guys also recommended me to visit Batık Camii, a mosque in a ***Stausee***, of which only the minaret can still be seen. Enes had done his thesis (Electrical Engineering) while working on the neighboring ***Staudamm***. I showed them a picture of the European version of that, the ***Grauner Kirchturm***.

> ![Sunset from Asım's apartment](/images/IMG_3454.JPG)

The next morning, Asım and me got up together and got on the bikes together. He rode to work, while I rode south out of Sinop. I was looking forward very much to seeing the sunken mosque an had decided to take the backcountry route to get there. On my map there were four different kinds of roads I could take. The red, double-stroked, were the ones where I had a wide hard shoulder all for myself, but loads of traffic. The red roads had slightly less traffic, but I had to share the road with the trucks and cars. The white kind of road we had already taken in Bulgaria, and I had no desire to repeat that experience. So the remaining were the yellow ones. I suspected them not to have concrete surfaces, but they were in nature; in fact there was a whole network of them. It was time to give it a try.

> ![Saying farewell to Asım](/images/IMG_3456.JPG)

After a short stretch on a main road, I finally took the turn away from the coast, and into the mountains. The roads were, as expected, not concrete, but good dirt roads, going uphill. I had not come across a supermarket before turning away from the main roads, so I did not have too much food with me. Just when it was time for lunch, I came across a nice picnic spot, where the ashes of a fire were still smoking, and I joined two men in the shadow of a tree. They seemed to belong to the construction machines which were parked at the side of the road. While I had my lunch (bread and ***Rosinen***), we had the usual hands-and-feet-Turkish-German-English conversation. When I had finished eating, a car arrived -- another three men got out, carrying loads of food. The smoking ashes were turned into a fire again, and I was forced to have a second lunch with them; they accepted no excuse.

> ![Construction worker lunch](/images/IMG_3460.JPG)

There were chicken wings and Köfte fresh from the grill, tomatoes, onions and bread, and as a dessert watermelon. When I wanted to continue, Ibrahim, the first of the workers I had met, insisted that I could not continue on the road with the bike, and that I should return to the main road by the sea. I insisted that I at least wanted to try, and he gave me his number, saying that I should call him if there was a problem and that he would come pick me up.

How he had put it, it sounded like the road would be blocked some time along the next kilometer. As this was not the case, I took it as a good sign that I would not have too many problems. A little bit later a car stopped to tell me that I could not ride this road with the bicycle -- a little bit irritated I said that I had gone 4000km with that bike, on different roads, and that I was quite sure that I knew what I was doing. After that, he let me pass.

> ![Beautiful backcountry roads](/images/IMG_3464.JPG)

The roads wound their way up and down the valleys, sometimes steeper, sometimes less, but always OK to go, in spite of not being made of concrete. It was challenging, slow, but nice way to go. Ibrahim called me during the day to ask whether I had a problem -- there was none. At the end of the day, when I was already quite exhausted, a car stopped. It was a couple; the driver got out and invited me to come to his house to stay the night -- pointing to a village way up the steep other side of the valley -- I was not quite sure whether I still had the strength to go up there. As the region did not look like it would be easy to find a campspot either, I decided to still go there. I arrived at their house completely exhausted, and ***Orhan*** welcomed me to a comfortable bench in the shadow.

> ![The relaxing bench for the evening](/images/IMG_3477.JPG)

He hand-picked some cherries for me in the garden, and we ate the cherries and sat together. We even communicated a little bit, via a lawyer in Istanbul on the phone, who spoke good English and translated for us. When it became dark, we went inside. Their house was super-cozy, and his wife ***İmehan*** had prepared dinner for us in the living room. As a starter, there was the lentil soup which the boys had prepared me the day before -- that way I got to know the "proper" version of it.

> ![The living room](/images/IMG_3480.JPG)

After dinner we had a Raki together, and I slept on one of the couches in the living room that night. In the morning we had breakfast together. Most of it was from their own garden; they had cucumber, tomatoes and own bees. Afterwards, I continued on my way. I had felt very comfortable with them, they made me feel like I was a family member of them.

The day had a trial for me in store. Right after I had lunch, the road suddenly ascended really hard, while it was very bad and hard to ride. Most of the time it was not possible to ride it at all. The ground was bare slabs of rock from time to time, with long stretches of coarse ***Geröll*** in between.

> ![A very bad road](/images/IMG_3495.JPG)

Due to the exhausting ascend, I several times hurt my ***shin bones*** with my pedals, and while stopping the bike at the slope twice lost control over it and it nearly fell over. It was again a very, very tough way to go. Luckily, the weather was not too hard on me all the while, the sky had clouded; that way at least only the road killed me, not also the sun. When I arrived on the height, it had completely disappeared, just like my forces. I was exhausted, surrounded by clouds and shivering slightly due to the cold.

> ![F***ing made it!](/images/IMG_3498.JPG)

> ![On the top](/images/IMG_3499.JPG)

Already on the way up, the roads had not been very precisely mapped. On the way down it became worse; I had to several times try a road for 500m until I knew it was the one ***designated*** on the map. At one point the actual road diverged completely from the map for multiple kilometers, but I managed to find it again later. Ibrahim called again to make sure that there was no problem.

> ![The road undulating to Uzunöz](/images/IMG_3507.JPG)

At the end of the day, I arrived in the village of Uzunöz. It felt strange arriving there. People ***flocked*** around me, laughing; I couldn't quite suppress the feeling that it felt like they were actually laughing at me. Two boys followed me on their bikes, most likely of boredom. Going out of the village, the road I had intended to follow was barred by a gate. There was a new road with a very good surface however, of which the boys insisted that it led to Duraǧan, where I wanted to go. I took it with ***gemischten Gefühlen***, as it was not on the map, remembering my last experience with unmapped roads. The guys kept following me even though it went uphill, making me feel uncomfortable. The one of the two kept asking whether I didn't want to camp soon, how much my bike cost and that he wanted to have the bell. I noticed with some ***Genugtuung*** however, that they were not much faster than me up the hill, even though I had already cycled all day and had loads of luggage while they didn't. When they finally no longer wanted to follow me, the brat made one last attempt to steal my hairband from my wrist, and after that they finally got lost. I continued up until the village was out of eyesight and camped on the open field next to the road, in the hope that bears would rather ***meiden*** the road when looking for food. The campspot was scenic, but I was not able to fully enjoy it because I still felt the bear-unease.

> ![Scenic campspot](/images/IMG_3510.JPG)

I had dinner well away from the tent, as it is recommended when camping in bear country, and for the first time on the tour played ***pot-into-tree***. In the evening a man came down the road, leaving me his phone number such that I could call him if I had a problem during the night. He lived in Üzünöz, and he made up for the bad experience in the village earlier: later on he brought me a big pot of yogurt and three loaves of flat bread, fresh from the oven and still warm.

> ![The result of today's round of pot-into-tree](/images/IMG_3512.JPG)

In the morning, I was delighted to hear that it rained; it was pleasantly cool. I had breakfast in the tent to be sheltered from the weather. As I did not want to pack the tent wet, I just went to sleep again afterwards. When I woke up again, it had stopped raining and the tent was dry -- perfect.

After a last, pleasant stretch of dirt road, I finally saw concrete again for the first time in three days -- I can't deny that I was very relieved. Right where I came to the concrete road, there was a picnic spot, littered as habitual. I sat down to cook my lunch. A little bit later, an SUV with two men arrived. One of them got out and made an accusing gesture that said "Come on!" at the many plastic bags on the ground, and said something in Turkish. I made an apologetic gesture at my bags, and said in German that I would take them with me again. To my surprise, the man answered with: "Ah, you also speak German!" He was from Hamburg, and in spite of being Turkish also, he spoke the respective slang exactly. He was a hotel owner in the area and a huntsman. He was looking for his dog, which lived and hunted wildly up there -- in fact, I had seen a dog passing by just when I had arrived at the picnic spot. He recommended me one of the three options I had to continue from now as "very scenic". As a huntsman, I asked him about the bears again, hoping to get some reassuring answer -- instead he said: "Yes, yes. There is almost everything up here. Perfect for hunting."

> ![Road down to Duraǧan](/images/IMG_3529.JPG)

In Duraǧan, I could finally re-stock my food supplies. While I was making up my mind what to buy, some men were inviting me for tea -- over a distance of approx. 300m, they were yelling "ÇAY!!" to me. In a supermarket, I got an ice tea for free and had a little chat in broken English, then continued along the empty reservoir lake on the valley floor outwards the mountains. It was already quite late, so I camped short after Duraǧan, in an open field, such that I would be visible (as a danger of course) to wild animals from far. After I had dinner, the farmers were herding their cattle back to the stables, and suddenly my tent was surrounded by a herd of goats and I had to chase the shepherd dog away from my food. The farmer asked me whether I was crazy (he waved his flat hand from side to side in front of his face with a questioning facial expression). Unsure what to respond to that, I just affirmed by saying "Evet".

> ![Surrounded by goats](/images/IMG_3537.JPG)

The road that had started flat along the valley floor ascended steeply the next morning. The sign said 10% ascension, but I think it were the steepest 10% on the tour so far. I had to ride the bike standing in order to keep it moving at all, and was slowly progressing up the mountain. As usual, cars were passing by and honked in salute. One of the cars stopped a little bit further up. The driver got out and waved at me to stop -- and then tried to persuade me to put my stuff into his car such that he could drive me up. It was quite hard to make him realize that I was doing this on purpose. It is worth mentioning that he already had his family of four in the car, and the trunk might have fit my luggage, but never the bike. Stopping at a well, I met a baker who sold me two loaves of bread and gave me a bag of cherries for free.

> ![The steepest 10% of my lie](/images/IMG_3539.JPG)

After a long and hard ascend, the road finally became flatter, going moderately up and down along the ridge. It was cloudy and pleasantly cold, with nice outlooks to the left and right. The landscape was barren and the clouds seemed to muffle the sound; it was a very magical environment.

> ![Long and lonesome road](/images/IMG_3554.JPG)

The ascend had taken its toll however, and I had to take a powernap in the afternoon, feeling to weak to continue. Shortly later I arrived at the pass, and the road descended, with some occasional ascends in between, down to the sea. In one of the villages, the farmers were slaugthering a goat on the road. I had never seen that live, the body hanging from a lamppost to bleed, while one of the people was holding the head of the goat by the horns.

> ![Sinop peninsula](/images/IMG_3581.JPG)

To my horror, three days after Sinop, the Sinop peninsula was still plainly visible on the horizon.

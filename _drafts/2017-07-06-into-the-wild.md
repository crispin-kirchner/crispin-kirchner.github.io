Entering Sinop, my tire was losing air slowly; I had to pump two times in the vicinity of Sinop. I entered using the western highway. When I arrived at the merging of the southern highway, I glimpsed a rare sight: another touring biker was just coming from the southern part. I started yelling to catch his attention, but ***selbstredend*** to no avail, so I mustered all my remaining strengths to increase speed and catch up with him. When I finally did, I realized that e was Turkish, so we couldn't even talk; but he made some gestures signaling that there was someone else who could speak English. A little bit further on the road, there were two more touring bikes. The other two were brothers from Iran who were doing a bicycle roundtrip through Turkey; they were on the way to Istanbul and would then head to the Mediterranean coast. While we talked, AsÄ±m, my CouchSurfing host for the net two nights came and joined us; as the cyclist meetup did not happen far from the meeting point we had arranged.

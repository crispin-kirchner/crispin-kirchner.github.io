Leaving Mesudiye meant one final ascent before I expected to be back at the D100 and out of the mountains again. It went way further up than I had expected. What I had thought would be one hour of upwards cycling turned out to be upwards cycling until the afternoon. The sight when I arrived up there was stunning, yet it made my stomach turn: I was not going out of the mountains, not going away from bears. I was descending into a beautiful, huge valley. The mountain range was way wider here than it had been further west.

> ![The sight down into the valley](/images/IMG_3751.JPG)

Naturally I was not able to capture the breathtaking view on the camera. What I saw was a valley that cut 1000m deep down into the mountains. Even though I was standing on rock-sloid ground, the height of the drop made me feel dizzy. Opposite of me, there was a huge wall of gigantic mountains, parallel to the one I was standing on, but higher. Repellant, yet beautiful, like the wall of a gigantic castle. Below the highest summits, the valley wall subdivided and there were countless smaller velleys cutting into the massive wall in front of me. It was intimidating and gorgeous at the same time.

I went down the drop on a very steep road, happy that I hadn't had to go up that way. On half te way I had to replace my rear brake pads. The city of Koyulhisar was the last one before I reached the D100. I did my groceries, and then said hello to my old friend, the Greece-Iran-highway D100.

It had changed appearance a lot since I had last been there. Between Edirne and Istanbul it had gone over softly rolling hills, close to sea level. Here, it was running inside the valley of the Kelkit Çayı, 900m above sea level and with mountains to both sides. At the next turn it became obvious that it had been a change for the better. Here I could see what my buddy Şaak had promised me some days before: A landscape I had never seen before. Turning round the bend, mountains of different colors of sand came into view, red, yellow, and orange, in between bands of green vegetation. The setting sun was highlighting the contours of the gorges between them, making their fine-grained surface texture show.

I built up my tent with mixed feelings in the evening. The highly frequented major transport route gave me some sense of security, it did not feel anymore like I was going in the wild. Yet population was sparse as ever, and the best camp spot I could find was in the vicinity of beehives, which are said to attract bears. I was very cautious, did the usual routine of storing my food on a tree far away, and mused over my options. My cultivated feeling of unease because of the wild animals made me think of quitting for the first time. Even if I might not be in a real danger, nobody is influence their feelings, and the constant unease was nagging at me, making me long for the safety and comfort of a home with walls of concrete instead of fabric. At the same time, I was not willing to give up the flexibility the tent gave me, having to look for couchsurfing hosts days in advance was not a tempting prospect. Also, couchsurfing would have meant giving up solitude and privacy, which I both appreciated a lot.

It was now close to the anniversary of the unsuccessful military putsch. Loudspeakers, as they are permanently installed in all villages in Turkey, were reminding the population multiple times a day about the "celebration of democracy". TV was showing images of the 15th July of the previous year, accompanied by dramatic music.

Sitting in the shadow next to a supermarket to have lunch, I had an interesting acquaintance. A German woman was coming along, inquiring what I was doing, rudely asking why I was sitting on the street like that, eating, instead of going to a restaurant. With a commanding tone, she invited me to the restaurant after my lunch, to have a tea. I didn't go. She also warned me not to cycle at night (as if I would even have thought of doing that), due to "strange people". While she was ranting, a friendly Turk came along and sat next to me on the curb. He didn't talk too much, but he invited me to his home to stay there for the night. I rejected however, as it was just the middle of the day. Without comment, he picked up my helmet and sunglasses and put them on.

> ![Turkish Crispin](/images/IMG_3788.JPG)

One of the options to overcome the bear problem was to ask people if I could camp in their garden. I could not imagine that a wild animal would go that far into civilization. However, the road was running along the valley floor and the villages were always quite a bit up the mountains. In the evening, my fatigue outweighed my anxiety and I camped in the fields next to the road. My pot turned out to not have been built for pot-into-tree: it was pretty dented after some uses, and I soon used stones to get the rope up into the tree. This was better, as it also always took me many attempts until I finally hit the spot where I wanted the rope to hang (anybody who has seen me throwing something knows why).

> ![Good campspot: morning shadow!](/images/IMG_3794.JPG)

The day after the putsch anniversary, I had lunch in a town at the town square. It was the first time since I was in Turkey that I was completely ignored by all people; nobody came to talk to me. I asked in two shops whether I could charge my laptop and was rejected in both; all this was completely unlike my previous Turkey experiences.

The next days, the road had gradually ascended and I was surprised when I was suddenly close to 2000m above sea level. In the evening I came by a hotel and was very tempted to go there; however it was still quite hot and I dreaded sleeping in a house, where it would again be way too hot to sleep properly. I had no water left and thought about at least asking for that, but then dreaded having to go up again, as the hotel was a little bit lower and off the road.

> ![No good camp country](/images/IMG_3833.JPG)

In the end I bypassed it, half an hour before camping time, without water. A few kilometers further, the landscape had changed tremendously. The hotel had been near a lake, surrounded by meadows. Up here, I was in a barren landscape with no vegetation and only rocks. The mountains on the horizon had patches of snow on them The next river was flowing in a deep gorge, 300m below me. This was no good camping country. In the end I did something I had never done before: I turned back. I asked for water at the hotel, and they led me to a room where there was what looked like a whole truck load of water bottles. I picked two liter of it. When I asked for the price, they gave me cookies and a muffin. The hotel even had a guard outside. I asked him for bears and was delighted to hear that there were none. Relieved, I put up my tent next to the lake, a little bit away from the hotel, in a gorgeous environment.

> ![The lake](/images/IMG_3818 - IMG_3819.jpg)

Between my campspot and the hotel, there was a ski lift, obviously this was a skiing area in the winter. I met three Kurds, of whom one could speak good English. From them I heard that I had entered the Kurdish regions of Turkey that day. They were really nice and tried to persuade me to sleep in the hotel, sounding like they would even pay for me. I spent the evening in the hotel lobby, using the WiFi for phone calls and blogging. When I went back to the tent, at eleven pm, the scenery was formidably similar to the video game [Slender -- The Eight Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_-Au4dWuQ0). I could have sworn that my footsteps on the gravel were making the exact same noise. My flashlight was guiding the way, blacking out everything outside the light beam. Walking, I realized to my horror that I on top would have to pass by the disused ski lift -- it was getting horribly similar. I comforted myself with the fact that the batteries of my flashlight were fresh. I was incredibly relieved when I had withstood that and had arrived safe and sound at the tent.

The pass the next day was at 2160m. The road down to Erzincan was quite steep, and I overtook some trucks which were going downhill at a rather slow speed. The valley was obviously prepared for vast amounts of melting water: At each side valley, there were huge, solid concrete bridges to protect the road from water and rubble.

The university in Erzincan was built as locked up as the one in Istanbul, however there were no guards, and so I went inside, had lunch in the stadium. I particularly liked the architecture of the entrance gate.

Camping next to the river Fırat Nehri, I had a bgorgeous view on the mountains. For the first time on my trip I had quite nasty ground and it was very difficult getting the tent anchors in. And even when I got them in, they were sitting quite lose. Luckily there was no wind that night. Having dinner next to the river, I saw with the corner of my eye a long leg, elegantly disappearing in a hole next to me. I jumped up immediately; if that belonged to a spider, it was a huge one and I was no longer interested in sitting there. Peeking into the hole however, I saw that it was a crab.

> ![Dinner with a view](/images/IMG_3870.JPG)

The next day I met a French couple who had started a little bit earlier than me, in Lyon. They were going at higher speed than I was, but they were also taking many, and multiple day breaks. We split up when they went for their midday break. To evade the heat, they started early in the morning and then took a break from 11am to 4pm.

When I had my lunch beneath some trees next to a village, I had to discover that my rear tire was losing air slowly. However it kept it for some time when I pumped. I paused at a gas station a little bit later, and after that the tire was flat again. I took off the luggage, fixed the puncture, but then was not able to find anything sticking in the outer tire which might have caused the hole -- very alarming. During the procedure, I also discovered a broken spoke in my rim. Triumphant, I took out the cassette remover I had bought in Slovenia and <s>removed the cassette</s> bent the derailleur hanger. Naturally I don't have this spare part with me -- I had heard that it's difficult to find the correct one and had shunned the effort back in Offenburg. Cursing, I jammed the cassette remover back into my tool bag, and wrenched the new spoke into the wheel the ordinary way.

After fixing the tire and the spoke, I readjusted the derailleur such that it would still shift with the bent hanger. The clerks of the gas station were impressed how many things were broken on my bike.

> ![External cooling is absolutely necessary these days](/images/IMG_3914.JPG)

The next day I had to pump twice before reaching the pass. Going down, I reached the next gas station on the last wisp of air. I again found nothing in the tire that had caused the puncture, even though I had turned it inside-out. The puncture pattern was always the same and greeted me like an old friend when I removed the tube. I decided that it was time to use the foldable tire that I had brought as a spare. It kept my bicycle rolling for about 5km, then it gave way to the classical piece of wire, which was so far the cause for 100% of my flat tires. While my original tire had kept the air for some time even with a punctured tube, the spare was completely useless, it was a matter of seconds until the tire was dead flat. At a nasty spot, in the direct sun and on the road, I put on the original tire again, cursing myself for having been that cheap when I had bought the spare tire.

The "old" tire kept me rolling until dinner, and I checked for bicycle shops in Erzurum, where I would get the next day. Luckily there were multiple, an outdoor store was even said to have "decent" tires, which was just what I wanted after my experience with my not-so-decent spare tire. After breakfast I had the usual tire fixing procedure -- same puncture pattern, nothing to be found in the outer tire. It was keeping air poorly on the way to Erzurum and I had to pump each 3km.

When it comes to air, I definitely prefer machines to humans. Whenever I talked to a human to get air into my tire, the result was not as desired. The funniest incident of that kind was in a Mercedes dealership. The guy seemed to have understood my problem, because he took a measuring device and saw that the pressure of my tire was below the recommended. My Turkish was sufficient to tell him which pressure was needed, and the compressor hose was just hanging from the wall. But when he had all the information needed to fill my tire, he just left, gesturing me to wait. Perhaps he first had to create a service request in the computer system, to fulfill the [CMMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) level, no idea what he did. But in fact he did not return, and after I waited for five minutes I went to the neighboring gas station. There was a machine; 5 button presses and my tire was at the necessary pressure again. Easy as that.

In Erzurum I had a quite typical experience: The bicycle dealer didn't have the requested type of tire, but "someone would come in 10 minutes and bring it". I was named a price, then I went in to look for an ATM and check the outdoor store. Arriving there 20 minutes later, I bumped into the owner of the first store, just leaving the shop with my tire. Naturally, it was cheaper over here. They called it "discount" to not make the other shop look bad. The clerk over there, Ertuǧrul, spoke very decent English. They had two tires in the exact size I wanted, such that I could replace the original- and the spare tire. I was happy, and Ertuǧrul brought me tea while I fixed my tire again.

> ![Ertuǧrul and me, after the work is done](/images/Ertugrul_and_me.jpg)

Ertuǧrul also recommended me eating a *Çaǧ Kebab* -- a horizontally-grilled Kebab. The places where he told me to go looked so expensive however, that I preferred to go for a vertical one next door.

On my way out of Erzurum, I came across the *Twin Minarets*, a historical building and the emblem of Erzurum -- many logos relating to the city are in the fashion of the two towers. It formerly used to be a Quran school, and today is used solely for touristic purposes.

Outside again, I met Necati. He is a carpet merchant, and used to live in Germany for some time. He invited me to have tea with him in his super-cozy shop. We talked about a little bit of everyhing, and he said a sentence I liked particularly: "The world is not evil. Only a few people are." He is a carpet merchant by passion. He told me thCMMIat it is far easier for him to buy carpets than to sell them, because he always buys them when he sees one he likes. Most of the carpets he sells are produced in the villages in the mountains, from the wool which is also produced there. It was obvious that it was pointless to sell me a carpet, but he was keen on emphasizing that he offers international delivery. So in case you need a beautiful carpet, write to [Necati](mailto:necatialaylar@hotmail.com). Instead of selling me a carpet, he managed to actually talk me into getting a sheep wool wallet, which actually now in Iran comes in handy because the bills are too large to fit into my regular wallet.

> ![Necati's shop](/images/IMG_3924.JPG)

He also recommended me to visit the Three Tombs in the vicinity. They are called tombs, however I was not able to find too much about them on the internet, not even whether they were just erected in the honor of some people or whether they actually mark their burial site. According to Necatin they were erected for three Sultans, Wikipedia speaks of an Emir. They are incredibly old, however: at least 600 years.

I continued downhill for 15 more kilometers and then camped next to a gas station. I realized that the toilets here (they are all squat toilets, with excellent water supply and bucket) are perfectly suited for showering. I celebrated that strike of creativity with a shower on the toilet. Cooking, I realized that I had forgotten to buy a spare gas cartridge in the outdoor store. I googled where I would find the next and cursed myself at least a hundred times, seeing the result. But there was no remedy, I had to go back the uphill 15kms the next day to get one.

To my annoyance, I saw the next morning that even with the new tire, the rear wheel had lost all of its air during the course of the night. It seems that the tube had been patched too often. Back in Erzurum, I again got "discount" on the gas cartridges. Being at it, I also bought two new spare tubes, as two of the tubes had been tortured quite a lot by the damaged tire. I visited Necati again and he could give the address of a tailor, to fix my torn sleeping bag inlay. He counseled me to ask for the price before having them make it. It was not necessary, I got the repair for free. After that I visited the Great Mosque, an ancient building. The praying room is subdivided by many pillars, giving a sense of cozy privacy.

In Horasan, it happened for the first time, that someone first shouted "Hello!" at me, and then "Money!" I was shocked. I had heard that this happened in very poor countries where there was still tourism, and where an unhealthy dependency between the tourists and the poor locals had been built up. I was surely not expecting this in Turkey. It made me feel uncomfortable and at the same time pitiful -- it was obvious that these two words were the only English these people spoke, yet education might be the only way to help such poor regions to build an economy.

* * *

One of the things that I learned about myself on this trip is that I prefer learning a language to coping with a language barrier. It feels like a nuisance to me to not be able to communicate precisely, and that conversations remain at a fairly basic level. However, the comical aspect of the barrier is not to be denied: There is nothing like another person imitating horns with the hands and mooing in order to describe the word *cow*.

> ![Beg forgiveness, for the end is near!](/images/IMG_3946.JPG)

After sleeping, I replaced the patched up tube in my rear tire with one of the spares I had bought in Erzurum, and the twelfth bar of the tire blues faded away. It was the day after I had seen the first sign saying *İran*, but I still had something on my list before I would cross the last border on my trip.

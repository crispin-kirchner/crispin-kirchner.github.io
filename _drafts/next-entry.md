The next morning, Mehdi got up early with me and helped me doing my groceries for the way. We went to a bakery where Sangak, one of the many traditional Iranian bread kinds, is made. It is baked in a large oven, on a bed of ***pebbles***. Because of the size of the oven, the bakers ***hantieren*** with tools made of sticks of multiple meters length. The dough is prepared on a board of approximately 45cm length, and then spread over the pebble bed, such that the finished bread is about one meter long. The final task, quality control, is left to the client: The finished breads are laid out on an iron grid, and the customer who bought the bread ***schnipsen*** the remaining pebbles out of the bread. When I had first bought a Sangak, I had naturally neglected this duty, and had bitten on a stone. Now I had many examples of this art by the numerous clients queuing before us. Fetching bread seems to be men's business, out of 12 clients, one was female.

I took my time to have breakfast with Mehdi, Ivana and Mateusz. It was difficult for me to leave the friends I had made in the last two days. The farewell from Mobin and Pouya the evening before had already been hard, I had really enjoyed the company of these two ***Tunichtgut***. Ivana asked an important question: She wanted to know how many kilometers I had to drive to Hashtrud that day. I did not know for sure any more, as I had looked up the distances while being in Marand, and guessed that it had been around 80km. I was wrong. Being on the road, I realized my mistake; for riding 130km, I had definitely set off too late.

Cycling on the road, a small ***Lieferwagen*** slowed down, and the driver asked me whether I wanted to have an ice cream. Sure I did, and so I stood in the sun with him a bit and we talked. He spoke quite good English. The ice cream he gave me tasted very unique. According to him, it contained pieces of a candy coming from Isfahan. While we stood there, another car stopped, and the driver asked me whether I was tired, offering me a ride. I was happy that I was still OK, as I would have had no idea how to fit my bicycle including luggage into his Peugeot Pars.

At the end of the day I arrived at the junction to Hashtrud. The city is "a little bit off the main road", as my host Fariba had called it. It were 30 more kilometers before I would finally arrive there, and unfortunately it would be hilly. It started off already with an ascend. Going up there I considered following Fariba's ***counsel*** of hitchhiking, as I was expecting to have to go back the exact same road on the next day.

As always there were many of the small Bardo pickups by Iran Khodro. They only seem to exist in either blue or white, and it would be quite probable that my bicycle would fit one of these. They are not unlike the Volkswagen Caddy 14D. Whenever I saw one approaching in my rearview mirror, I stuck out my thumb half-heartedly, but none stopped. When I had already given up and was concentrating on cycling up the slope, one of the white ones slowed down next to me. In it sat father and son, and the latter spoke quite good English. We had the usual small talk of where I was from and where I was going, and then they drove on again. Some meters later they put the car in reverse and asked my opinion on what the boy should study when he finished school in order to get a good job, and on how to emigrate to Germany. I had gotten that question every now and then, but unfortunately still could not tell them more that I guessed that one needed a Schengen working permit in order to go to Germany to work. In the end they invited me to their home as well -- obviously neither Warmshowers nor Couchsurfing were necessarily needed to have a place to sleep. I rejected though, as I already had a place to stay for the night.

To my delight, of the 30km to Hashtrud, only the first five were uphill, and it felt like flying, covering the last part of the distance. To my right, the sun was setting over the dusty hills and was making the desert glow orange.

> ![Still on the D100](/images/IMG_3224.jpg)

The next time I left the D100, I was a little bit surprised of myself: I seemed to have learned from my errors. I took a road which was on the map. I had been getting too much of the traffic on the D. The most annoying thing are the trucks; whenever the street becomes narrow, they become a both a nuisance and a danger. The road led north, and I took it for no particular reason, expect that it took me away from the traffic.

> ![My path away from traffic](/images/IMG_3229.JPG)

The relief was instantly; I was on a small road which led through some villages and was slightly ascending. Its winding path led up into the ***Pontic Mountains***, which separate the Turkish main land from the Black Sea coast. In this area, they are smooth hills, standing close together and densely covered with woods. Further up, the road connected the villages in a [bus topology](), passing by the villages on the ***Grat***, with dead ends reaching down to the settlements.

> ![The road winding its way along the mountains](/images/IMG_3234.JPG)

The biggest settlement the road came across in the mountains was ***Ovicek***. When I reached there the next morning, it was the second day of Ramazan Bayramı, the celebrations after Ramadan. In front of the bakery, an old man asked me to take a seat. He offered me the perfumed water which seems to belong to the equipment of every desk in the country, I had been offered it before but hadn't known what to do with it, so I had refused. This time accepted, curious to see what would happen next. Actually not a big deal: the water is just rubbed between the hands, and whoever has a beard puts it in there. Seconds later I was equipped with a beard smelling of mint. The bread I had intended to buy was given to me for free by the man. As a farewell, he offered me some sweets. It was a ***zäh***, but well ***bitable*** mass, evidently made of sugar, with some fruit flavoring an ***bestäubt*** with ***powder sugar***.

After ***Ovicek***, my way led me down again, this time on a road running along a steep abyss at the edge of the mountain, through low needle forests.

Down in the valley I stopped in a village to have lunch in the shadows of a small group of trees. Sitting and eating, the Muezzin started calling, and I was surprised to hear that it was a woman, as I so far had only heard men doing the job. The sound of the soft voice sounding through the village had something magical.

While I was sitting there, eating, a man came along. He put his hand on his chest, made a nod in my direction and said: "Hoş geldiniz" -- "Welcome". I had heard of people who had had this experience, but it had never before occurred to me in my life that a total stranger wished me welcome -- I was ***taken aback***, touched, and just managed to say "Teşekkür" -- "Thank you". The man seemed to be living right next to the place where I was having my lunch, and he had many beehives in his garden. I saw him going there with a small ***Kännchen*** in his hand, from which smoke ***evaporated***. He opened one of the beehives and took out one of the honeycombs. I thought he was just doing some routine work on the beehive, but a little bit later he came out to me, still holding the honeycomb his hand. He had me clean the packaging my cheese had been in, and then cut out big pieces of the comb. He gave me one piece straight from the knife. Putting it into my mouth, I squashed it between my tongue and gums, the sweet honey completely filling my mouth, and it tasted like the best honey I had ever eaten. He put so much honeycombs into my cheese box that it was impossible to close it, and I had to eat some honey before I could continue.

Continuing over the next chain of hills, I am also greeted with "Welcome" at the next gas station, where I first did some groceries, and then took a seat for a while in the manager's office to work on the blog, as I was at that time working on the migration to GitHub. The manager, Medhin, was very kind to me, and gave me a lemonade from Safranbolu and halva from Kastamonu to try.
Halva has now since some time become my breakfast, together with bread. It's a little bit like the generalization of marzipan; a solid mass made of sugar and ground nuts or grains, most often sesame.

> ![Peanut halva](/images/IMG_3333.JPG)

Medhin also recommended me getting a Turkish friend, and going to Sinop, according to him a historically important city at the black sea coast. I took it into account; while seeing the Black Sea had not been part of my original plan, it still tempted me.

> ![Medhin in his office](/images/IMG_3253.JPG)

I followed the D30 another day. After 3700km from my starting point, I finally had the first puncture -- a piece of wire had worked its way through the outer tire. The next day, my desire to leave the D30 grew again, so I organized a CouchSurfing host in Sinop and went north another time. 

> ![Interesting rock formations along D30](/images/IMG_3255.JPG)

It was the last day of Ramazan Bayramı, and I was in a mountain range again. When I came across a nice river with shadowy trees, I sat own a bit to work on the blog. When I got up again, the lawn around me was filled with families. As I got on the bike again, they all invited me to eat with them. No matter how much I wanted to go on, it was impossible to fake that I did not understand what they meant.

> ![Picnic with a Turkish family](/images/IMG_3262.JPG)

> ![Brazier for preparing the minced beef](/images/IMG_3263.JPG)

They prepared different kinds of meat on different grills, which we ate wrapped in bread, with fresh vegetables and loads of fresh-cut parsley. Everybody was paying loads of attention to me, making sure I always had something to eat at least in both hands. Therefore, most of the time I had meat and bread in my right, and *karpuz* -- watermelon in my left hand. They also had snake meat, which to me tasted just like any other meat, just that it was much tougher. It was nearly impossible to bite off a piece -- one had to rip it apart using teeth and hands.

> ![Snakes on a grill](/images/IMG_3265.JPG)

Later we went swimming in the river, which was not entirely harmless, as it was quite a torrent -- we jumped in, floated for some meters and then got out again to avoid hitting some rock. While the men undressed but for the underwear, the women just went in with all clothes on.

Kastamonu was the biggest city I came across on my way to the coast. It has an old castle which overlooks the city, which seems to also make it a tourist destination. There were modern residential buildings, and an interesting, modern mosque. I met a supermarket clerk, Mesut, who spoke very good German, and we had a nice chat. He told me that Mesut Özil is from that region. I went up to the castle to enjoy the view over the city.

# The Fauna

That night, I found a campspot that was well hidden, but next to the road. Sitting in the tent after nightfall, I had to realize that I was not the only one appreciating the privacy of the place. I heard feet next to the tent, then a grunt. Short silence, then a sniffing noise. Obviously, a ***wild pig*** was standing right next to my tent. The bad thing was that I had my food in the tent -- the last time I had taken ***wild pig*** precautions had been in Slovenia. So I sat there, trying to not move or make any noise, hoping against hope that the pig would disappear again, scared to death. It was so close that I could tell by the smell that it was a wild pig, not only by the noises. After another sniffing noise, I heard it walk away and grunt again. Once there was nothing to be heard, I straight away grabbed the backpack with the food and put it out of the tent.

After that encounter, I wanted to sleep close to civilization next, somewhere a wild pig would not dare to come. I was still half a day from the coast, inside a beautiful mountain scenery. The only civilization I came across were ***Teestuben***, so I asked in one of those whether I could just camp behind it on the lawn. The people there were really helpful, and told me that it was not a problem for them, but that they did not recommend camping there, as there were bears and wolves in the region. I was taken aback; my wild pig problem had suddenly tripled into a wild animals problem. I asked whether they knew something close by that was suitable for animal-free sleeping, and they suggested an abandoned hospital close by. But first, they invited me for tea; and during the course of it offered me to stay in their ***teestube***.

> ![Ertuǧrul (center) and his little brother](/images/IMG_3334.JPG)

During the evening I talked with Ertuǧrul, the older one of the two boys working there; he improving his English and me improving my Turkish -- using Google Translate. He was 17 years old, yet it seemed to me that his life was already like that of a grown-up: he worked in the ***Teestube***, because it belonged to his family; his little brother was helping. I pitied him, because he seemed smart to me and I felt that he should be given the opportunity to make more of his life, perhaps study.

The ***Teestube*** was a simple building made of boards of wood, wrapped with ***Plane*** to keep the wind out. The door had to be locked to close at all, in the center there was the tea oven -- all in all it reminded me a lot of *Minnie's Haberdashery* in the movie *The Hateful Eight*. Only that there was no basement. I had a wonderful, bear-free night on the pleasantly cool concrete floor.

Starting the next morning, it was only a short drive until the road started descending to the Black Sea. The coastal route started bad, as it was under construction where I met it. Therefore it was a dry, dusty dirt road which I had to share with many trucks, which were leaving me constantly surrounded by dust.

Dogs seem to be always the same, no matter where one meets them. They are ***Großmäuler***. When you pass them by on a bike, they bark. Often they even follow, but always keeping a distance -- once you stop, they will stop as well -- bloody cowards. I have to endure a lot of barking on this trip, and there is nothing I could do that might annoy the dogs as much as they annoy me. When the road is particularly hard, be it due to high temperature or just exhaustion or both, I often yell "Halt die Fresse!" -- "Shut up!" at them, in the hope that it is intimidating enough for them to stop barking. It rarely is. One day I even got an answer to that -- though not from the dog. A voice came from above, asking: "Do you speak German?" It was a woman from Gelsenkirchen, on her holidays visiting her parents in law; I suddenly wished I had been more polite with the dog.

My last night before couchsurfing was very unpleasant, coming down from the mountains the temperature increase was evident, and it was hard to find good camp spots next to the coastal route. I had to resort to a spot where there was no shadow; neither in the evening nor in the morning. I sweated a lot that evening, but got a gorgeous sunset as a ***Trost***.

> ![Sunset at the Black Sea](/images/IMG_3359.JPG)

On the last day to Sinop, the road left the coast for some time, going up a bit. For the first time on my tour, to my delight, I met a *living* turtle. It sat next to the road, feeding. Remembering the numerous turtle corpses I had already sen, I picked it up and carried it away from the road, into a meadow. It was quite big, just the size such that I could still carry it with one hand.

> ![Living turtle](/images/IMG_3366.JPG)

I had my lunch in the shadow at some tables next to a supermarket. The dog of the owner came by. As I was not on the bike, it did not bark at me, but kept staring at me while I ate my food, obviously begging to also get some. At first it only stared. Then it started touching the table with its paw, to get my attention. When that did not work, it came round the table and started ***patting*** me with its paw -- as said, dogs are the same everywhere.

> ![Hungry eyes](/images/IMG_3369.JPG)

> ![Relaxed stray dog](/images/IMG_3372.JPG)

The dog was however not the only animal encounter of that lunch: on the leg of a chair, there was a huge butterfly; luckily it was lazy enough to be ***photograhed***. It sat there throughout my whole lunch. The bottle on the picture is half a liter.

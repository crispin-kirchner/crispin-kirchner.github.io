This article is part two in the trilogy of long anticipated events. While the last article described the crossing into a new culture, in this article I will reach Istanbul. The next article will complete the series by dealing with the first time I left Europe. But let's go back to where we last stopped: Edirne, right after the Turkish border.

We had a quick breakfast in the morning and then went to have another look at Edirne when there was daylight, planning to go cycling again after lunch. I wanted to go see the bridge we had seen when cycling into Edirne from closer. In fact it was two bridges, spanning two arms of the same river. Both are built in the same fashion, one shorter, one longer. The one we had seen from far was the longer one. They are quite narrow, such that two cars can pass by each other, but only if the pedestrians evade onto one of the narrow sidewalks.

As Maik's handlebar was quite low, and he was therefore getting lots of strain on his wrists, we were also trying to find an extension to his fork's tube, such that the handlebar would be higher. We had seen this on the bike of the German cyclist coming from China, who we had met in Sofia. On the way back we stopped at a shop selling used bicycles and parts. He didn't have something like that, but called a different store in Edirne for us, where we would find such a part. Fortunately it was on our way out of the city, so we went back to the hostel, wrote some postcards, had lunch and then headed out of the city.

The store was run by bicycle enthusiasts, and they had more than one fork extension to choose from. We spent quite some time there, talking to the owner while Maik's fork was getting the extension fitted. He told us that the shop itself had a WarmShowers profile and offered us to stay another night; which we declined as we wanted to continue. While we stood there and talked, other touring cyclists approached the shop. They were three French people, a couple and a solo cyclist. I had already heard rumors about the couple from other touring cyclists in Serbia: they went on a tandem, where the front position was like on a recumbent bike, while the rear position was normal sitting. They were really nice, we chatted all together, about our trips, how we came. They even gave Maik and me a test ride on the front position of the tandem. It was a rare gathering, five touring cyclists in one place had never happened before so far.

There were some difficulties with the repair, and because the shop people were nice they also greased Maik's brake strings -- in the end everything took quite a while. So when we were getting ready to leave again, it was already 4pm. We shortly considered cycling two hours and camping somewhere against staying and having a longer break; the decision was easy. As I had programmed most of the night before at the hostel, I was completely done and very tired, so we asked whether we could stay for the night. We were led into an apartment that seemed to serve three purposes: living, hosting touring cyclists and as a shop warehouse. The numerous guests had all left messages on the kitchen tiles.

I slept well that night, although I was a little bit scared that the wall of bicycles next to my mattress might fall over during the night. But fortunately nothing happened.

The next morning, we had a tea with our host in the shop (they had started as a cycling café and then started the shop), and he was very eager to get us places to sleep at for the next two nights. So before we left, he had already organized us something to sleep in Lüleburgaz, and recognized us a WarmShowers host for the day after that. We left, very grateful.

On the D100

That day we did not take a nice route over the villages as before, but decided to go for the fast lane: the D100. We did this to check out how it was to ride on the D roads in Turkey, but also because Maik's setup had changed, it was reasonable to go for an easy and short route that day. In spite of the traffic, the roads are a nice way to go, as there is a wide hard shoulder one can ride safely on. I felt it was a little bit frustrating to have such a monotonous route; the landscape was only changing slowly and the road kept going up and down always in the same fashion, and very exhausting on the long run.

When we stopped at a supermarket, we experience the Turkish hospitality once again: Without further comment, a man delivering goods to the supermarket gives a box of ice cream to Maik.

This article is part two in the trilogy of long anticipated events. While the last article described the crossing into a new culture, in this article I will reach Istanbul. The next article will complete the series by dealing with the first time I left Europe. But let's go back to where we last stopped: Edirne, right after the Turkish border.

We had a quick breakfast in the morning and then went to have another look at Edirne when there was daylight, planning to go cycling again after lunch.

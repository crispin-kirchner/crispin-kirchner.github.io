One of the main points in doing this trip was to get out of the christian-western bubble in which I grew up, to see a world that’s new to me and widen my horizon. I had the privilege to be able to travel a lot throughout all my life, yet I had never yet left Europe. The furthest I felt from home was in Iceland, the furthest east I've been was Prague, but that's... well, let's talk about something different.
Leaving western Europe when crossing the border to Croatia has already been a pleasant change, but I knew that there would be more to it; and indeed there was.

After София, the norming phase of the team "***Reiseradgruppe*** Sonnenschein" was over, the roles and responibilities set: Maik was the fast one, while I was trailing behind. When most of the day was done, we normally unleashed: Maik would go as fast as he liked and we agreed on a meeting point further along the road where he would wait for me and where we would decide to call it a day or continue. In this constellation, we (meaning Maik first, me second) arrived in Пазаджик. Maik, being the WiFi-***Spürnase*** had found a spot where he had internet while waiting on me. Checking my mails, I got the notification that the paper I had co-authored with my colleagues in Sweden had got accepted for the ECSA2017 (European Conference on Software Architecture). If I had learned one thing from my researcher lunch mates up there, it was one thing: celebrate first, then read the reviews. And this was what I did.

Continuing, we reached Рловдив in one of the next days. It is the ***second biggest*** city in Bulgaria and one of the oldest cities in Europe. As I had finished the book I had picked from a public bookshelf in Italy (a terribly cheesy cliché lovestory), I went to a bookshop there. I found a cozy small second hand shop, where I could leave the old book and got three new used ones, one of these being a book about Bulgaria's history. From that moment, I was ready to annoy Maik every now and then with some random facts about Bulgaria, e.g.: "I was not aware that the cyrillic alphabet was invented in Bulgaria, did you know?". After getting this ***wise-guy*** equipment, we locked our bikes and had a look at the city from above. The city is built on multiple hills, and one of them carries the remnants of an old fortress. We had a gorgeous view over the whole city and I took some pictures of what (again) fascinated me the most: the residential blocks in the suburbs.

Cities always include heavy trafficked roads. As Рловдив had fed us up with these, we decided to leave the main road for some time. We use OpenstreetMap for navigating, a map of the world, created by volunteers all around the globee and provided to anybody free of charge. Same as me, only knowing western Europee so far, most of these volunteers, and the volunteers writing the software which displays the map on our phones, live in their bubble. Cycling long distances, this has the funny consequence that no only the world around you changes, but also the way the map looks like. Well, nearly. In fact, the map looks the same everywhere, only the reality corresponding to the map changes. While in Germany a solid line represents a concrete road, a dashed line a dirt road and a dotted line a really bad dirt road, we had to learn the hard way: Standards are different here. So there we went, following the solid line on our map, looking forwar to getting rid of the traffic. We got rid of the traffic, yes. But the price was a very bumpy dirt road that was especially bad for riding with a travelling bike: As the bike is eavy loaded, one does not want to go trough holes and over bumps at high speeds, in order to not unnecessarily break things. Therefore we crawled along a 10km segment of our journey, only a little bit faster than walking pace, in the blazing sun. ***It was hard on us***. But w got to see a rare sight: wild hemp was growing next to the road. Maik explained to me that in these areas, the climate conditions are ideal for this plant. After we had managed the hard stretch, we rewarded ourselves an ice-cream in the shadow, totally exhausted.

Same as having a nice campspot, finding a nice place to have lunch is always a treat, and sometimes it needs to be defeated, even against military force. ***Es begab sich also*** that we were travelling along a long and lonesome road in the midday heat and started to feel hungry, when all of a sudden, there was an ***Abzweig*** to the right. It led to some kind of locked up area, but the important point was that there were tables *and* benches under small roofs -- meaning the ultimate combination of shadow and comfort. As this is nothing you come across each day, we were decided to eat there. But we had not taken into account the ***Endgegner***. When we were unpacking our food, we made the acquaintance with the most unfriendly Bulgarian we had met: He was a guard of the locked up something we were eating in front of. He told us that we could not eat there because it was a military area. While it was quite plausible that the wall and buildings he was guarding were actually military area, it seemed quite strange that the publicly accessible road, where there was no gate or similar, should also belong to this complex. We therefore protested that in our opinion, where we were was public space. The guy still insisted that we left, but we decided to just stay and see what happened. The guard informed us that he would call the military. While Maik was of the opinion that they would be slow in arriving, I was of the opinion that they most likely would not care. In any case, wse cooked at record speed -- one hour later we were back on the road, until then nobody had showed up to ***vertreiben*** us. The ***Endgegner*** was sort of defeated, by ignoring him.

Everybody who once was a child knows that there are situations when one bites more than he can chew. Maik and me had such a revival of our childhood when we went to Haskovo the next day. In the supermarket, we got one of the occasional warnings about neighbouring countries ("Don't go to Turkey, there's a civil war!" -- "Oh, I didn't know. Since yesterday?" -- "No, since ten years!") and lots of food. The endeavor for that bday's lunch was a noodle salad, and we both liked the idea that much that we ended up with both our camping pots filled with it. It was delicious, but too much. In the end it felt like the noodle salad had finished us instead the other way round.

It had been a long time since we had last seen rain, in fact the last rain must have been in Sofia, at the other side of the country. The roads were as heated as we were, and we came to witness the ***Schauspiel*** of steaming roads. Cycling through the mist felt a little bit like going to a ***Thermalbad*** and yes, the cool down was more than welcome.

In the evening, we were treated very nicely in a village. We stopped there to fill the water bag for having a shower in the evening. It felt a little bit like being magnetic, because in a matter of minutes, a flock of children was surrounding us, following us as we went to the store. They didn't speak English, but it was written in their faces that they were fascinated by our bikes, looking at them from each possible angle. The shop owner told me that he had once worked in The Netherlands for some time, and gave each of us a snack bar and a cucumber as a present. We camped close to that village in the evening, on a campsite with a view and still with privacy. There were beautiful mineral rocks everywhere on the ground, which were semi-transparent, and very nice to look at.

The next day we take a break in a cafe with WiFi, to check the route to Edirne and check whether we had any luck with our WarmShowers requests. We obviously learned nothing from the noodle salad incident and are got ***Gelüste*** when we looked at the selection of cakes in the café. Two idiots, one thought, we just ordered everything they have on a big plate. The cakes were delicious, and we realized that it's not too far to Edirne any more, and Maik booked us a hostel for that evening. Luckily, our estimations about how much we can cycle are better than those about how much we can eat. Completely fed up with cake we got on the bikes again, looking forward to a tough second half of the day, but also to the Greece crossing, which promised better cyclable routes. And it was another country I hadn't been to before!

In Greece, we got an unexpected surprise. The road we were cycling on seemed to end in a river! My first thougt was that there would be a ferry, but at the second glance it occurred to me that the road just crossed the river -- only under the water surface. While going through the river, I got the idea that we should take some photos here, after all I hadn't gone through a river before. I yelled over to Maik to stop. Turning his head, he pointed out to me that he couldn't stop because he was weearing closed shoes which would get wet. To his and my surprise, the head was not the only thing turning in that situation -- Maik including the bike turned 90 degrees around the driving direction, meaning not only Maik's shoes got wet. Naturally he was completely pissed, but he surprised me another time -- he went from totally pissed to relaxed again in about 30 seconds -- an exceptional quality that ***ausmachen*** a perfect travelling buddy. As the shoes were now wet anyway, we could proceed with the photos.

As Maik had got his complete bike used, he was using a very old Brooks saddle. The saddle had a ***Riss*** in the leather, and we were consiering it only a matter of time until it would tear apart completely. Maik had got a spare saddle in Sofia, so we were anticipating this moment quite relaxed. Right after the road in the river, the time for the saddle ha come -- although not how we would have thought. Maik announced that the saddle was broken, and then showed me where -- the steel frame had come apart; the leather was still intact.

After the short distance through Greece, it was time for the goal I had anticipated over the past weeks: I would finally, for the first time of my life, cross the border to Turkey. At the border, there was no mistaking which country we entered; the white half moon on red ground was to be seen everywhere. The procedure was as ***gewöhnlich***. The ID card is sufficient for German citizens, a passport is not necessary. We still got a piece of paper which we will have to show on exit, which carries our entry date (up to 90 days are allowed). I also got the first baggage control of my trip. Luckily it did not include unpacking all the bags, that would have taken at least half an hour I suppose.

> ![Still on the D100](/images/IMG_3224.jpg)

The next time I left the D100, I was a little bit surprised of myself: I seemed to have learned from my errors. I took a road which was on the map. I had been getting too much of the traffic on the D. The most annoying thing are the trucks; whenever the street becomes narrow, they become a both a nuisance and a danger. The road led north, and I took it for no particular reason, expect that it took me away from the traffic.

The relief was instantly; I was on a small road which led through some villages and was slightly ascending. Its winding path led up into the ***Pontic Mountains***, which separate the Turkish main land from the Black Sea coast. In this area, they are smooth hills, standing close together and densely covered with woods. Further up, the road connected the villages in a [bus topology](), passing by the villages on the ***Grat***, with dead ends reaching down to the settlements.

The biggest settlement the road came across in the mountains was ***Ovicek***. When I reached there the next morning, it was the second day of ***Ramazan Bayram***, the celebrations after Ramadan. In front of the bakery, an old man asked me to take a seat. He offered me the perfumed water which seems to belong to the equipment of every desk in the country, I had been offered it before but hadn't known what to do with it, so I had refused. This time accepted, curious to see what would happen next. Actually not a big deal: the water is just rubbed between the hands, and whoever has a beard puts it in there. Seconds later I was equipped with a beard smelling of mint. The bread I had intended to buy was given to me for free by the man. As a farewell, he offered me some sweets. It was a ***zäh***, but well ***bitable*** mass, evidently made of sugar, with some fruit flavoring an ***bestäubt*** with ***powder sugar***.

After ***Ovicek***, my way led me down again, this time on a road running along a steep abyss at the edge of the mountain, through low needle forests.

Down in the valley I stopped in a village to have lunch in the shadows of a small group of trees. Sitting and eating, the Muezzin started calling, and I was surprised to hear that it was a woman, as I so far had only heard men doing the job. The sound of the soft ***Gesang*** ***schallen*** through the village had a special ***Zauber***.

While I was sitting there, eating, a man cam along. He put his hand on his chest, made a nod in my direction and said: "Hoş geldiniz" -- "Welcome". I had heard of people who had had this experience, but it had never before occurred to me in my life that a total stranger wished me welcome -- I was ***taken aback***, touched, and just managed to say "Teşekkür" -- "Thank you". The man seemed to be living right next to the place where I was having my lunch, and he had many ***Bienenstöcke*** in his garden. I saw him going there with a small ***Kännchen*** in his hand, from which smoke ***evaporated***. He opened one of the ***Bienenstöcke*** and took out one of the ***Waben***. I thought he was just doing some routine work on the ***Bienenstock***, but a little bit later he came out to me, still holding the ***Wabe*** his hand. He had me clean the packaging my cheese had been in, and then cut out big pieces of the ***Wabe***. He gave me one piece of ***Wabe*** straight from the knife. Putting it into my mouth, I squashed it between my tongue and ***Gaumen***, the sweet honey completely filling my mouth, and it tasted like the best honey I had ever eaten. He put so much ***Waben*** into my cheese box that it was impossible to close it, and I had to eat some honey before I could continue.

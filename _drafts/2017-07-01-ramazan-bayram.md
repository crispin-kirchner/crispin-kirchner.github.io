> ![Still on the D100](/images/IMG_3224.jpg)

The next time I left the D100, I was a little bit surprised of myself: I seemed to have learned from my errors. I took a road which was on the map. I had been getting too much of the traffic on the D. The most annoying thing are the trucks; whenever the street becomes narrow, they become a both a nuisance and a danger. The road led north, and I took it for no particular reason, expect that it took me away from the traffic.

The relief was instantly; I was on a small road which led through some villages and was slightly ascending. Its winding path led up into the ***Pontic Mountains***, which separate the Turkish main land from the Black Sea coast. In this area, they are smooth hills, standing close together and densely covered with woods. Further up, the road connected the villages in a [bus topology](), passing by the villages on the ***Grat***, with dead ends reaching down to the settlements.

The biggest settlement the road came across in the mountains was ***Ovicek***. When I reached there the next morning, it was the second day of Ramazan Bayramı, the celebrations after Ramadan. In front of the bakery, an old man asked me to take a seat. He offered me the perfumed water which seems to belong to the equipment of every desk in the country, I had been offered it before but hadn't known what to do with it, so I had refused. This time accepted, curious to see what would happen next. Actually not a big deal: the water is just rubbed between the hands, and whoever has a beard puts it in there. Seconds later I was equipped with a beard smelling of mint. The bread I had intended to buy was given to me for free by the man. As a farewell, he offered me some sweets. It was a ***zäh***, but well ***bitable*** mass, evidently made of sugar, with some fruit flavoring an ***bestäubt*** with ***powder sugar***.

After ***Ovicek***, my way led me down again, this time on a road running along a steep abyss at the edge of the mountain, through low needle forests.

Down in the valley I stopped in a village to have lunch in the shadows of a small group of trees. Sitting and eating, the Muezzin started calling, and I was surprised to hear that it was a woman, as I so far had only heard men doing the job. The sound of the soft voice sounding through the village had something magical.

While I was sitting there, eating, a man came along. He put his hand on his chest, made a nod in my direction and said: "Hoş geldiniz" -- "Welcome". I had heard of people who had had this experience, but it had never before occurred to me in my life that a total stranger wished me welcome -- I was ***taken aback***, touched, and just managed to say "Teşekkür" -- "Thank you". The man seemed to be living right next to the place where I was having my lunch, and he had many beehives in his garden. I saw him going there with a small ***Kännchen*** in his hand, from which smoke ***evaporated***. He opened one of the beehives and took out one of the honeycombs. I thought he was just doing some routine work on the beehive, but a little bit later he came out to me, still holding the honeycomb his hand. He had me clean the packaging my cheese had been in, and then cut out big pieces of the comb. He gave me one piece straight from the knife. Putting it into my mouth, I squashed it between my tongue and gums, the sweet honey completely filling my mouth, and it tasted like the best honey I had ever eaten. He put so much honeycombs into my cheese box that it was impossible to close it, and I had to eat some honey before I could continue.

Continuing over the next chain of hills, I am also greeted with "Welcome" at the next gas station, where I first did some groceries, and then took a seat for a while in the manager's office to work on the blog, as I was at that time working on the migration to GitHub. The manager, Medhin, was very kind to me, and gave me a lemonade from Safranbolu and halva from Kastamonu to try.
Halva has now since some time become my breakfast, together with bread. It's a little bit like the generalization of marzipan; a solid mass made of sugar and ground nuts or grains, most often sesame.

Medhin also recommended me getting a Turkish friend, and going to Sinop, according to him a historically important city at the black sea coast. I took it into account; while seeing the Black Sea had not been part of my original plan, it still tempted me.

I followed the D30 another day. After 3700km from my starting point, I finally had the first puncture -- a piece of wire had worked its way through the outer tire. The next day, my desire to leave the D30 grew again, and so I organized a CouchSurfing host in Sinop and went north another time.

It was the last day of Ramazan Bayramı, and I was in a mountain range again. When I came across a nice river with shadowy trees, I sat own a bit to work on the blog. When I got up again, the lawn around me was filled with families. As I got on the bike again, they all invited me to eat with them. No matter how much I wanted to go on, it was impossible to fake that I did not understand what they meant.

They prepared different kinds of meat on different grills, which we ate wrapped in bread, with fresh vegetables and loads of fresh-cut parsley. Everybody was paying loads of attention to me, making sure I always had something to eat at least in both hands. Therefore, most of the time I had meat and bread in my right, and *karpuz* -- watermelon in my left hand. They also had snake meat, which to me tasted just like any other meat, just that it was much tougher than mormal meat and it was nearly impossible to bite off a piece -- one had to rip it apart using teeth and hands.

Later we went swimming in the river, which was not entirely harmless, as it was quite a torrent -- we jumped in, floated for some meters and then got out again to avoid hitting a rock. While the men undressed but for the underwear, the women just went in with all clothes on.

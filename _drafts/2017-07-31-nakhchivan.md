The officials on the Azeri side of the border were very polite and friendly and made me feel very welcome. One could tell that it was also for them a rare sight to have a cyclist ante portas. One of them spoke some English and helped me through the whole process. They actually checked the stamps in my passport, and looked for a long time for the Turkish entry stamp, even asking whether I had a second passport. When I showed them the paper with the entry stamp, they were satisfied. I had to smile when they asked why I had spent so much time in Turkey.

I could change my money straight at the border post. The exchange office consisted of a man with Turkish Lira in his left- and Azeri Manad in his right pocket. The design of the bills carries some similarities to the Euro notes.

The country right after the border post was dusty and barren, but that changed soon afterwards: at least along the main road, the plains of Nakhchivan are watered with a network of pipes and channels, making it a very green, fertile land; sometimes even to the limit of swampiness.

To the right (west) of the main road, a wide plain stretches to the border of Iran. Behind it, huge mountains loom. To the left, the Zangzegur Mountains rise, with the Armenian border hidden somewhere inside them. Immediately after the border it became quiet. The honking was far less than in Turkey. Either there is a law against pointlessly blowing the horn in Azerbaijan, or maybe it was just some self-fulfilling prophecy of mine, or maybe there was just less traffic -- whatever it was, I felt more relaxed driving on the Nakhchivan roads.

The most palpable difference had already been visible on the Turkish side of the border: cars. It seemed that Nakhchivan people got their cars over cheaper trading routes than in Turkey, as big sedans, often of German make, characterize the streetscape. What made Nakhchivan particularly interesting was that both the Turkish, as well as the Russian influence was noticeable. This was also reflected by the cars. One of the cars I saw the most was one I had never seen before: Волга sedans. And in reminiscence to the weeks I spent in southeast Europe, there were also numerous Ladas in the streets. Also, I was frequently asked whether I spoke Russian, which seems to be the most important foreign language here.

In the evening, I camped on a willow a little bit off the main road. Thanks to the watering channels, I had a very pleasant shower and could do my laundry. I watched the sun tinting the Zangzegur Mountains orange while I had dinner, when a farmer boy came along to collect the cattle. He immediately got out his phone with Google Translate, and invited me to his family's home. He (Rashad) told me that they had a guitar, so I was eager to come with him.

Arriving there, I was asked whether I wanted to drink beer. They then went to a supermarket and put a 1l bottle of beer in front of me -- quite a challenge for someone who only drinks beer occasionally. However it was the beer I like most: beer from the region, produced somewhere in Nakhchivan. Fortunately they did not seem to expect me to finish it. Very late in the night, we had dinner together. It was very delicious, seasoned with coriander. Rashad and me took turns in playing the guitar and singing, however I could not really hold a candle to him. It was a great, laid-back atmosphere, they made me feel like I was a family member of them. They invited me to come with them to the village wedding the next day.
When I wanted to say farewell to go to my tent, they led me to a readily prepared bed in the living room, so I only went to the tent to gather my things.

It was evident that the whole village already knew I was their guest; after breakfast the next morning, suddenly the police officer sat at the table to check my passport and visa. Due to the wedding invitation, I for the first time on my journey felt the urgent need of shaving. Family Kmlv felt the same, and the father made an appointment for me at the barber. Somewhere close to Şərur, Nakhchivan, I got the first professional beard cut of my life -- and the barber wanted no money for it.

When I told them what my job was, I got the usual question of whether I could fix their computer. It has been some time since I did this on a regular basis, but I was delighted to be able to show them my gratitude for their hospitality by helping them in something I was good at. Unfortunately the motherboard of the computer was broken, but they had a second computer which also had some flaws, and I was able to build one working computer out of two broken ones.

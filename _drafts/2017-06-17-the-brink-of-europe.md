The day we wanted to reach Istanbul, we had an ambitious goal: it was over 100km to the city center. At the next possible location, we checked for news about the WarmShowers requests I had been sending -- with the disappointing but somewhat expected result that we only got half an accepted request, which is as good as none. I then frantically started writing requests, in the hope of still getting something. When we checked later on again, the situation had not changed, so we went for the habitual option: Maik booked a hostel. I still had to celebrate something: my favorite shared flat in Berne had accepted to have a phone call with me. A long while later, when we had hit the 100km mark, we arrived in the periphery of Istanbul. Maik was wondering whether there would be public transport to carry us into the city, but I was determined to go by bicycle -- I had gone so many kilometers by bicycle and was not willing to break with the principle of only cycling on my journey. Mustering our last strength and courage, we set off to take on the last part of that day's trip. It's not long before we find ourselves on the outermost lane of a heavily trafficked road with three lanes, and realize that we have to get to the leftmost. a little bit later, Maik's navigation repeatedly crashed and we started using my app for navigation. I am not keen on doing this, because the voice guidance is pretty bad and had already often misled me. However, as Maik had no voice guidance at all, it seemed like the most reasonable approach, so I stuck in my earphones and went first. A little bit later, the periphery suddenly ended again and we were on a dirt road out in the open fields -- it had just been another disconnected suburb.

When the road made a sharp bend to the right, my navigation told me to go left. At the same time, a turk started to talk something to us, naturally we didn't understand, but the essence was that he agreed with my navigation software -- going right led nowhere. The bad thing was that going left did not lead anywhere much either.

The path to doom (i.e. the railway)

The narrow bad path full of rubble led steep down into a railway course, with about three meters of height difference. The Sofia experience was about to be repeated. We were equally exhausted and saw no way of getting our bikes down there, not talking about getting them up again. Fortunately, there was this heaven sent guardian angel who helped us with all of this -- without him, our trip would have been extended by another 10km at least, which would have been fatal.

After this adventure, we were back on a main road again, which would bring us to the city center from now. Often times we had to cross multiple lanes or go straight where many were leaving the highway. It was heavy traffic, and putting much stress on us, but overall, it was feasible. The cars were many, and it was madening to keep them all in sight, but the drivers were paying attention as well. In fact they were so cautious with us that the only dangerous situation ended in a car taking damage, but leaving me unharmed: At one of the many off-ramps where we were continuing straight while the cars exited on the right, a driver tried to exit after having overtaken me. He kept a huge distance to me and was obviously more concerned with keeping me from harm than with where he was driving: When he was about to go into the greenery he hit the brakes really hard, leaving two stripes of black on the concrete, but it was too late. The car front hit the stones at the border of the greenery, while the car wet over it. To my astonishment the driver did not care enough to even stop -- he just went over the greenery and joined the traffic on the off-ramp that way.

When it started getting dark, we each got two vegetarian Çiǧköfte as a dinner, eating one straight away and then continuing. The navigation then led us into a dark side alley, where I lost orientation, as the reality was no longer corresponding to what the map showed. In addition, I did not feel safe going into this empty side street, nor did Maik. He soon got me to return to the lightened main road again, which was definitely a good decision. I might have been the one following the route and leading us, but in our exhausted state we definitely needed both our brains to survive. Later on I once again needed Maik's help in order to find the way to the on-ramp of the next road we were about to take. With time, the traffic was becoming slower and the sidewalks more lively. The only ones still taking our right of way were the taxi drivers, but I had long ago started to follow Maik's example of yelling at them when they did it. They still took our right of way, but the yelling was very pleasant, as it gave relief to the mental strain I was feeling.

Following the road, we were suddenly at the coordinates of the hostel, which was the biggest relief of all. It was 11pm, and we had successfully fought our way into the heart of this ***20 million*** beast! Naturally the journey was not over: There was no hostel to be seen. But the locals were wary: a guy sitting in front of a hotel asked us if we were in search of the hostel, and then called someone to guide us there. A minute later, a guy appeared. We expected to go round the corner, but things turned out differently. Our guide was going on a quite long walk with us, down multiple streets and away from the noisy, lively part of the city -- the whole thing felt quite fishy. We kept asking where he was guiding us, suspecting to lose at lest one kidney each in this. We arrived at a residential building, were shown the code to the front door, with no satisfying explanation why the hostel was at a different location than it said on the website. I have not seen the movie "Hostel", and I am grateful that I haven't, and in that moment I think it was a lifesaver, I guess I would have panicked completely. Maik stayed with the bikes, I went up to the "hostel" (a.k.a. apartment) with the guy, keeping my pepper spray at hand. In the end, all turned out well: they just had that additional apartment for the case that the hostel was over-booked, we saw the next day that this second hostel was even on Google Maps -- so in the end everything was fine.

# Istanbul

Some time ago, in 2015, when I was all caught up in university stress, I was looking for ways to drive my thoughts away from how behind I was with my studies. I came up with imaginary hitch-hiking: I asked myself the question: "If you went hitch-hiking tomorrow, where would you go?" The answer to that question represented the need to get away as far as possible from my current situation: I chose Istanbul. To be ready at any time to go there, I wrote the name of the city on a big piece of cardboard and hung it to my wall, also to remember myself that there was more to life than studying. Naturally, the sign was never used, but it laid the foundation for my desire to go there one time. It represented the dream of seeing big, ancient buildings topped with domes and surrounded by minarets, overlooking a vast city with lots of water.

That said, Istanbul was another important checkpoint on my journey. While going into the city the night before, all I had seen were some colorful lights, traffic and pedestrians moving in the semi-darkness of the megacity. Now in the morning w went over to the main part of the hostel to have breakfast. It was located on the uppermost two floors of a high old building, in Istanbul's old town, with a narrow winding staircase leading up there. Going up there this morning, still feeling the strain of the last long day of cycling in my legs, I was very happy that we had had a shorter way up with all our luggage in the second part of the hostel. The efforts were rewarded, however: the breakfast was served in a cozy dining room with a terrace and an outlook over the old town, the dome of the blue mosque so close that it felt like it was possible to just reach out to touch it.

After breakfast, we went for a walk through the city. We did not get far until we came across the French couple with the recumbent tandem, who were also staying in a hostel in the old town. They were staying in Istanbul for applying for their Iran visa and were having a week of waiting ahead of them, as they just now ha applied for the reference code. We exchanged our experiences in getting into the city. They told us about a hint they had got from another cyclist to evade the murderous traffic at least on the way out: taking a ferry straight from the oldtown to the south shore of the Marmaran sea. I desperately wanted to cycle over the Bosphorus bridge however, so I was only listening half-hearted. They also showed us pictures of their last campspot: Right at the shore of the Marmaran sea. Maik and me had avoided going there, as the map indicated that the shoreline was completely built up with hotels and the like.

We then started our city tour by walking through the Gülhane Park, then continued to the edge of the oldtown peninsula, to enjoy the magnificent view over the Bosphorus. The water color was of a magnificent blue, and I couldn't resist the temptation to roll up my trousers a bit and step into the refreshing, ankle-deep water. However, I hadn't payed enough attention, for a boat had just passed by -- seconds later my trousers were wet up to the thighs.

Next, we went over a bridge and up the hill of the Beyoǧlu district. At the foot of the hill there was a store for outdoor gear, and I got a new threaded gas canister. Halfway up we took a break in a café, which had artfully crafted radiators. We had a look at the Galata tower from close by and continued to the Taksim square.

For the way back to the old town, we took the metro and exited at the university. From there, we started our search for Baklava. Our appetite was huge as always, so we first got some packed Baklava, but when we came across a café where the prices for it were also moderate, we did not hesitate to go in there as well.

Maik is in posession of a steel mug, which he can use on his cooker to make a cup of coffee in the morning. As I wanted to have a similar comfort for making tea, we also set out to find such a mug. We tried the Grand Bazaar. In principle it seemed to me like the predecessor of today's malls. It is a cavernous maze of many narrow alleys lined with small shops, only in a historical building. What's also interesting about the building is that the floor is not leveled, but follows the ups an downs of the hill on which it is built. Same as in the metro, there were safety checks at the entrances. However they did not seem effective to me, as the gas canister I was carrying with me was ignored all the time. I didn't have to open the bag even once, although I was carrying a metal canister with explosive gas in it. The shops inside the bazaar seemed to be specialized entirely on tourists, something plain useful like a steel mug was not to be found.

Leaving the bazaar, we witnessed a scary sight: all shops around us were closed, the alleys deserted. It was Saturday, and we were suddenly worried that we would fail to get more to eat for the rest of the day than the packs of Baklava we were carrying. Heading towards the Blue Mosque our worries were dispersed at once, however: some streets further down, we were all of a sudden in a street completely packed with people, and with all shops open to the left end right.

We got an inanely expensive (meaning ordinary German prices) Pide for dinner. The diner in which we got them was exceptional, however: they had opened a hole in the floor leading down to the basement without putting up any "watch out!" signs. For ordering, Maik stepped right next to the hole -- it was just sheer luck that he did not fall in, but we laughed it away together with the employees, who had tried before to cautiously draw our attention to the hole, such that we would not make rash movements next to it.

After the pide we continued to the Blue Mosque, whose proper name is *Sultan Ahmed Mosque*. As Maik had announced before, it carried lots of similarities to the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, but was smaller. Especially the Minarets seemed clinched in comparison. In the interior it was evident that this mosque was better being taken care of than the less famous in Edirne. However, the ambient could not compare at all. The mosque was full of chattering tourists. As visitors were asked to carry their shoes with them in plastic bags, the rustling of these was as omnipresent as the constant noise of hundreds of voices. There was a division of where believers and where tourists were supposed to be, but the concept was not effective, as the great majority of visitors seemed to be believers who were tourists at the same time, with only a small number of people actually praying and a vanishingly low number of people seeming to respect this. No, the Blue Mosque did not succeed in radiating the holy dignity of it's sibling in Edirne.

We went to Hagia Sophia next, as it's a direct neighbor of the Blue Mosque. It currently serves as a museum, and therefore has a quite ridiculous entrance fee -- we decided to just have a look at it from the outside, by walking once around it completely. It's architecture is impressing, with very big, defiant walls to support the huge dome. In contrast to the delicate artwork inside Sultan Ahmed Mosque, it seemed quite coarse, for example the windows are just plain glass squares.

Later, back in the hostel I mused about the question of how to leave Istanbul the next morning. It was not an easy decision, but I came to the conclusion that I valued staying alive higher than crossing the bridge to Asia. Furthermore, based on the assumption that Europe is a continent, it felt reasonable to go over to Asia by boat. In order to completely avoid traffic on the way to the ferry, I spent lots of time that evening looking in turn at OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and Google StreetView, in the end coming up with a solution that avoided big main roads altogether. When I finally turned off the light to sleep, it was already late. To my surprise, I then noticed that it was not dark in the room, in spite of not having a window -- the walls had been painted with a fluorescent color. Concluding, this room united everything that can be negative about a room: no fresh air due to a lack of windows, yet still no darkness in the night.

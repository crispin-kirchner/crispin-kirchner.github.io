Back in Sweden, I had a very wise colleague, ***Dragule***, who is working on his PhD. One day during lunch, many of us were sitting together, and we chatted about how things in life never got easier. His very optimistic opinion was, that hardship was just a part of life and that we were in the progress of learning it. He compared it to eating. He remembered us how it must have been when we were children, having to hold the spoon, balance the food on it, stay concentrated such that nothing fell off while we slowly guided it towards our month. The fact that at this time, we all had to consciously think about every component of this complicated movement, while we were now sitting together, doing it all automated, having a chat while eating. His point was that coping with hardship was something conscious which caused us lots of trouble right now, but that we would practice it, equally to eating with the spoon, until it became an automatism. This in mind, I expected to experience some more hardship to cope with on my journey. However, so far there has been next to nothing of it -- cycling each day comes far less hard than writing a thesis. At least than writing a thesis in a subject for which you need no special abilities, just enough boredom to care. So, hardship did not come along by itself when cycling, but I succeeded in producing it out of thin air -- completely self-inflected, and therefore with all the more reason to get it out of the way myself. This is why this post is called *Hardship*.

Back in Istanbul, we had to get up very early in the morning, in order to catch the ferry. Istanbul showed itself from a very pleasant side: There was no traffic on our way there, the roads deserted, and we got to the port free of stress and way ahead of time. This was a good thing, as there was again the cumbersome but ineffective (we had knives and again multiple gas canisters in our luggage) safety check, which meant we had to take off all the luggage from the bikes in order to pass it through the scanners. We took a nap during the crossing. The coast on the other side of the Marmaran sea was lined with hotel sky-scrapers until down to the shore. The city seemed deserted, it gave the impression that it was only built for tourists and we were out of season.

Maik and me had a short, tearless farewell, then Maik set off as the first; if I would have gone first we would have met again straight away. With a festive gesture, I took out my compass again and took the road that led east -- the coastal route. There was a steady up and down, and at the first occasion where the shore was accessible, I took a bath. I have to admit that I did only use the compass for the first half of the day, then never again. I had gotten accustomed so much to using the map that I could see the advantages of knowing where I was going. And I still did not have to plan too much long-term in spite of using the map. One more thing I took over from our joint time was structure -- Maik had had a very good inner clock such that we never ended up looking for a tent spot too long and never had lunch too late in the afternoon, as it had happened to me often while being alone. I therefore set two alarms each day: one for lunch and one for camping.

Doing my groceries that day was an unpleasant experience. The shop clerk spoke quite decent English, and when he learned that I am from Germany, he proudly showed me his Swastika wristband. I backed away and asked whether he thought that was funny. His reply was no, but that he liked Hitler. My question of how it is possible to like someone who was responsible for the death of 6 million people was left unanswered, he cowardly excused himself by saying that his English was not sufficient to discuss that. He elucidated however that Germans only disliked Hitler because of Jewish media -- I then stopped talking to him. He said goodbye to me with a Nazi salute. I had never seen this in real life, only in movies, and it gave me a chill down the spine.

South of the Marmaran sea it was absolutely necessary to go on concrete roads. The ground here was like clay; after a rainfall it seemed to take several days to dry, and there seemed to be rain every other day. While the ground was wet, it would stick immediately to everything that touched it: If I wore my flip-flops and made the error to step outside the concrete, they were twice as heavy when I lifted them again, stepping a second time made them so heavy that I had to fear their strings would tear. With the bike it was even worse: the ground stuck to the tires, such that the wheels blocked, more than once I had to remove the mud with my hands in order to get the bike out of the mud. It soon became a best practice to remove the luggage from the bicycle on the road, before going camping, because the amount of mud that stuck to the tires seemed to be proportional to the axle weight. I was lucky to have this kind of ground in Turkey; in each village there are public fountains for washing, which came in handy as well to clear the mud from the bicycle.

To have the interview with the shared flat in Berne, I needed internet. The region where I was had no hostels, and as the hotels for one night were more expensive than the

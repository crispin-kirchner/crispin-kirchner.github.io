We had to get up very early in the morning, in order to catch the ferry. Istanbul showed itself from a very pleasant side: There was no traffic on our way there, the roads deserted, and we got to the port free of stress and way ahead of time. This was a good thing, as there was again the ***l√§stig*** but ineffective (we had knives and again multiple gas canisters in our luggage) safety check, which meant we had to take off all the luggage from the bikes in order to pass it through the scanners.

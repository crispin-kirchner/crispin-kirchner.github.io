A traveling bike draws attention. For that reason, the officials at the Iranian border treated me with priority. I had queued as everybody, but seeing the bike they asked me to come to the front of the queue. However, a traveling bike also seemed to require ***Penibilität***, and so I was again the reason for an ever-growing queue, but still too tired to care. The official even went to his superior to discuss something, clacking his heels in salute. After some questioning ("What's the purpose of your travel?" "What's your itinerary?" "Which embassy did you get the visa from?"), I was invited to cross over with a warm smile. From that moment on, I was treated very gently, the lady at the baggage control even giving me hints on what to visit in Julfa. Just outside the border station, I got a welcome selfie with a jolly local. Slowly rolling through downtown Julfa, many people addressed me in English, wishing me welcome. At the same time, I slowly begin to realize how badly I was prepared for that change -- I didn't speak the language, couldn't read the script. Even the numbers are written differently in Farsi. I had no internet connection to make up for the lack of knowledge, and I didn't have any money in the local currency, nor did I know the exchange rate for sure.

Consequently, I entered the first bank I encountered. The clerk did not speak English, but I could make myself understood by showing him a fifty dollar bill. The people next to me at the counter carried large bundles of Rial notes in plastic bags, and I ***inständig*** hoped that I would not get to carry such an unhandy amount of bills. The bundle of 50 000 Rial notes that I got in exchange for the fifty Dollars was impressive enough, but luckily still fit my ***pouch***, however on the verge of ***sprengen*** it. My confusion was completed when the clerk noted down the exchange rate. It looked like something close to 8000, while I had had roughly 40 000 in the back of my head. I accepted that as this was my first "withdrawal", that it was the way it is and I would get a better rate next time.

Still with the 8000 Rial per dollar in the back of my head, I went to get some cheese. The ***Verkäufer*** asked 2500 Rial for it, which seemed reasonable, given the 8000-rate. When I gave him a 5000 note, he however started to explain me that the last zero on the notes did not count, asking for a 50 000 note instead. I was reluctant to give it to him, however, as the whole thing was utterly confusing to me. When he suddenly offered to give me the cheese for free, I decided that it was high time to count my bundle of Rials. Computing the exchange rate myself, I actually came to a result close to the 40 000 in the back of my head, and the price the ***Verkäufer*** was asking no longer seemed ***unverschämt***.

In fact, there are unofficially two currencies in Iran. The official is the Rial. However, all prices are given in Toman, which is the name of the old currency which was abolished in 1925. The value of a Toman is informally agreed to be 10 Rial. To make things slightly more complicated: Iran's national bank plans replacing the Rial with a unit that's worth 10 000 Rial each. Guess what the name will be -- You're right, it's Toman.

I decided to get an Iranian SIM card next. I asked multiple people and got directions to a shop, however I was still not able to find it. I gave up for the moment and started to look for my groceries, which was not easy either, as shops over here seemed to be more specialized on one particular thing, and I was not able to find something that resembled a supermarket enough to reach my needs.
This was when Mohammad asked me whether I needed some help -- he is a taxi driver, and speaks very decent English. He told me where I could get all my groceries, including fresh-baked Sangak bread, and walked me through the city in search of a shop selling SIM cards. We tried three until we found one that had what I needed.

On the way back, there were at least three more people greeting me and welcoming me to their country. The most impressive was: "Welcome, thank you for visiting my country. If you need anything, I am here for you." Imagine someone doing that in a western country.

While crossing the border, my rearview mirror had broken off. Leaving Julfa, some meters were enough to convince me that it was essential to have one. The traffic and also the general acoustics (honking) were quite similar to Turkey. I fixed the mirror with the two most essential spare parts: Duct tape and cable ties.

Leaving Julfa, the road soon narrowed down to one lane in each direction, going uphill through a dry, dusty landscape. The car drivers seemed to pay attention to me, I never had to evade anybody. However, people were quite relaxed while overtaking; a car overtaking another would sometimes take ages to pass by, and with oncoming traffic, three cars abreast plus a bicycle, it was sometimes quite narrow on the two-lane road.

A little bit before Marand, my optimism was stifled. On an entirely empty road, a car packed with youngsters overtook with no safety distance at all, honking in the very moment they were next to me, obviously with the goal of frightening me. They managed, and luckily failed to kill me incidentally.

In Marand, my host Saeed picked me up and led me to a house he owns. As he was already having the parents of his wife around, I stayed in the house instead of his flat. He apologized all the time that he was sort of "parking" me there on my own, while I was unable to make him understand how much I had craved for just this -- being on my own and in a protected environment. I asked to stay second night, to relax a bit, and Saeed luckily agreed.

Later, we had dinner together with the whole family. I had to discover that I was not yet familiar to the customs. Arriving, I shook hands with his father in law. When I wanted to proceed shaking hands with his wife, she politely receded. We had a delicious dinner in the -- like they called it -- *Iranian* way, meaning sitting on the floor instead at a table.

The second day in Marand, I planned my route for the following days. After Tabriz, I would have had the option to either go north to the Caspian Sea, or continue straight to Tehran. Both cases meant finishing too early, and I decided to take a longer break in Tabriz to make up my mind on whether to re-book the flight to an earlier date, or idle away the remaining time.

Going to Tabriz, the colorful mountains again caught my eye. They look like they are just sand mountains, but I guess it's actually sandstone. The looks are stunning, because they exist in many different colors, with red being predominant.

Twice there were tiny tornadoes, whirling around cardboard boxes and dust. To prevent falling I had to stop, clutch the bicycle and close my eyes until they had passed.

Although it is a quite big city, the traffic in Tabriz was pleasant to drive through. The highway had four lanes, of which the leftmost two always went over the junctions, while the rightmost were for the cars taking the junction. The trick to get through there unharmed and fast was to always drive in the middle of the road, on the line between the overpassing and the branching lanes. While it felt odd to go in the middle of a four-lane road, with cars passing by to the left *and* to the right, this was the only way to avoid both the risky lane changes and junctions.

My host Mehdi, who is slightly younger than me, welcomed me very warmly to the home of his family. The house is in a residential area with alleys so narrow that cars cannot easily pass them. As a result, there is no traffic and the area is very quiet. In their yard, they keep hens and have a grapevine which forms a roof of leaves over it.
Mehdi's room, and especially his wall, reminds me a lot of myself. Just like me, he had 

For dinner, Mehdi took me to the most fancy place of the city -- a mall. I was taken aback by how money makes everything the same and even erases the cultural differences between Iran and Europe. It felt and looked just like any mall anywhere in Europe. We met up with two fun friends of Mehdi, Pouya and Mobin.

As a guest I got a room on the top floor, which, quite typically, did not have any furniture, but carpets. The house is built in a way such that it is ventilated naturally, with a pleasant, cool breeze blowing through the rooms all through the night. On the whole trip, I had never slept as well as in that night.

The next morning, Ivanka from Croatia and Mateusz from Poland joined us. We had a delicious breakfast together. They introduced me to what we called *sweet cucumber*, because it tasted and looked just like that. According to Mehdi it is a certain kind of melon in an early maturity state. After that we went to the Bazar, where Mobin and Pouya joined us again.

> ![One of the entrances to the Bazar](/images/IMG_4234.JPG)

The Bazar is huge, far larger than the one I had visited in Istanbul. In a maze of narrow alleys with roofs, masses of locals and few tourists squeeze through. Numerous patios allow to catch a breath under trees, next to a water basin. Most of the shops are being delivered using big, custom-welded pushcarts from massive square profiles. Their drivers split the crowd by shouting "Yalla" in a regular rhythm, which means "come on" or "let's go". According to Mehdi it literally translates to "may god help you". Some of the shops get their deliverance with motorcycles driving through the crowds.

When I got hungry, I got a big, heavy pack of dates (probably 2kg), which should accompany us during the next days.

For lunch, we had a unique and very delicious cultural experience. It was a dish consisting of sheep meat, cooked with tomatoes and chickpeas in a strong broth. It was served in a cup, with bread, a pestle and a bowl. As the starter, we tore the bread to small pieces, poured the broth over it and ate it as a soup. Then we mashed the meat and vegetables with the pestle and ate the delicious mass as the main course.

In the afternoon, we visited the municipality palace, which these days serves as the municipality museum. As weaving carpets is a traditional and important industry in Tabriz, the museum houses a carpet hall, displaying some impressive pieces of this handicraft. While some of the carpets strike with almost photo-realistic portraits, others try to impose with sheer size. The largest one is the *mother carpet*, measuring 112m².

> ![The mother carpet in the municipality museum](/images/IMG_4275.JPG) 

We visited the *Arg of Tabriz*, a huge remnant of a massive fortress in the middle of Tabriz. The fortress was built in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The remaining wall is among the highest historical walls in Iran and so massive that I was immediately reminded of The Wall from *A Song of Ice and Fire* -- only made of stone instead of ice. For some time, I just sat in the pleasant shade of the impressive building and enjoyed the sheer, awe-inspiring size of it.

The last stopover in the city was the Kabud mosque, also known as the blue mosque. In contrary to the blue mosque in Istanbul, it lives upon it's name. The mosque was completed in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, and lay in ruins since an earthquake in 1780. The reconstruction started in the seventies. The reconstruction is incomplete up to today, for example the minarets are missing and the outer walls remain modest, displaying the bricks. These imperfections however made it one of my favorite buildings on my journey; it gave the building a welcoming, down-to-earth atmosphere.

In the evening we hiked up Mount Eynali, which is a popular leisure destination for Tabriz' inhabitants. The sun had already set when we started our ascend. In contrary to the daytime, the air was clear and we had a gorgeous view over the sea of lights produced by the 1.7 million city.

On the way back home, we took one last detour to taste different local ice cream specialities. I decided for a ***something***, an ice cream with whipped cream, pineapple and ground pistachio. Mateusz tried a typical Iranian ice cream in the form of noodles.

According to Asım, Bafra is famous for its Pide, so I had one when I arrived in the city. I could choose what should go on top by myself, but as my Turkish was and is quite limited, and I had no idea what the options were, it became a rather ascetic pide: cheese and egg. It was circular, like a small pizza, and made in an oven with open fire.

In Bafra I also bought a loudspeaker, such that I could announce my presence to wild animals in a comfortable way; the throat gets sore when you sing all the time. At a gas station I stopped to fix it to my bag, and then spontaneously stayed there to do some writing, as the people were nice and there was a comfortable couch. One of the clerks spoke quite good English, and they even served me tea and watermelon. They recommended me going to Batık Camii a second time, and I left quite late from the gas station, as the way was not far and I had planned on camping there.

I had strong tailwind going there, and there was not much height difference to cover, so I arrived after what felt like very few time.

The atmosphere at the lake was really nice. There is no tourism at all, the people living around the lake are normal locals and for them it is just a nice sight, having the mosque in the lake. There was a spot where I could descend down to the lake and climb the remnants of a sunken building, nice to take pictures.

Down there I met a father with his two childrens, and after a two-word chat ("It's very nice here") he invited me to have dinner with his family.

Because I was faster at Batık Camii than expected, I went back and camped in the vicinity of Bara that evening. In the evening I suddenly heard shots from quite close to the tent, and instantly yelled, such that whoever was shooting there would hear that there was a person there. I then went to the road where the shooters stood -- they had been shooting to the sky with ***Platzpatronen***, as they were guests to a wedding. They straight away invited me to come with them, but I rejected because I had already showered and was in my ***pyjamas***.


In Samsun the next day I got a spare ***Schlauch*** for my bicycle, the shop owner was so friendly to sell me his private spare one, as the others he had in store did not have ***Autoventile*** and would therefore have been quite unhandy. He also tightened my headset again. During the course the unsuccessful thread of the fork finally gave way -- the washer sits quite tight, but it most likely will not be possible to tighten it properly again. I'm still quite confident I will make it to Iran that way. After that I had lunch at the beach.

The way out of Samsun was tough, loads of traffic on a road that was frequently too narrow due to construction sites. It was hard to find a camping spot that evening, as there was only few willows around there. As the main product of that region are hazelnuts, they were grown on every available square meter, and the fields were surrounded by fences. When I in the end found something it was already close to mosquito time, so I built up the tent fast to be safe from then. However there were suddenly many people stopping by, counseling me not to camp there because of the midges, so I first had to get rid of these ***counsellors*** before I could get rid of the midges. One of these was particularly nice, he returned later on with his son and they brought me watermelon and olives. I thanked them and then failed to tell them in sign language that I didn't need anything else, which is why they set off for the supermarket and shortly later brought me bread, cookies and coke. Then they luckily handed me a German woman on the phone who was interpreting for me.

In Fatsa I took a longer break to write postcards. When I asked in a post office where I might find some, the post officer first made tea for me, then told me where to go. When did it last happen to you that a post officer brought you tea? In Fatsa I then ***took to*** the mountains again, with the intention to cross them, such that I would end up at the D100 again, the Turkey-Iran highway. This mant that this was my definitive farewell from the Black Sea.

When I was already looking for a camp spot, a car stopped by. In there sat four police officers, inviting me for tea in their police station, five kilometers up the mountains. At steep slopes, tis translates to an hour riding time. They didn't accept a no, however, so I half-heartedly accepted continued riding. It was not all steep uphill, so it was faster than an hour until I got there. Two villages before the police station, two officers were already looking for me in their ***Dienstfahrzeug*** to tell me where to go -- they were so keen on getting me there that it sort of felt fishy, so I wrote to my brother, just in case that this was the last time my family heard from me in a very long time.

When I arrived at the police station, one of the officers guided me inside and asked me about the route, continuously insisting that I could not go there. Like ever so often, I did not get a response to the "why", and so I filed it under the usual: car drivers that don't realize that it is indeed possible to go uphill with a touring bike. There was only one question where I felt slightly uncomfortable: They were asking whether my trip was entirely touristic, which I affirmed straight away. They drove me to a Köfte restaurant in the city with their ***Dienstfahrzeug***, were I got Köfte, tea, and Ayran. Their car was ***particular/peculiar*** in one way: it was not possible to fasten the seatbelt. While I was used to Turkish people never fastening their seatbelt, I was still impressed to find that the seatbelts of the police car were ***eingeklemmt*** behind the backrest of the seats and impossible to get out.

Back at the police station we watched some television. It was the tenth of July, and the propaganda machinery was already preparing the population for the 15h, the "very bad day for Turkey", as the officer called it. They seemed to be showing images of the ***misslungenen Putschversuch*** all day, all the days before the ***Jährung***. It is ironic to see that the Turkish government has their people celebrate this "bad" day.

When I brought the subject on camping, the officers made many phone calls; they for some reason didn't want me to camp in the vicinity of the village. When I wanted to start off, the officer told me to "wait for some minutes". I didn't really want to, so he told me tat he had arranged someone from the next village to pick me up. I didn't like that at all, because I did not want to skip 10kms of uphill cycling. However minutes later there was a pickup with two people who had come all the way just for me and I didn't have the heart to tell them that I wanted to cycle and camp somewhere, so we loaded my bicycle. The police officer had finally gotten my point and therefore told me he was sorry, but couldn't hide the smirk, seeing that he had won me over.

> ![Magnificent sunset during the drive](/images/IMG_3646.JPG)

On the bicycle, Turkish drivers were constantly honking at me. It was nothing new to me that they used their horn a lot. Going with the two people in the pickup, I could gather some new knowledge about Turkish horn usage. The river went at maddening speed and used the horn when he overtook, before he went round a bend, and sometimes occasionally in between -- the horn seemed to be the signal for: "I am going too fast to react in time, can somebody else pay attention please". I was relieved that it was not a police car -- I was able to fasten the seatbelt.

I was most surprised when they dropped me off: According to my experiences so far with Turkish people, I would have bet that I would sleep at their place. However, they brought me to the gas station in the next village, where I could camp on the lawn. I felt very disappointed for not having gone these 10kms by bicycle; camping on some lawn was something I could have done one village earlier as well.

The landscape the next day was still very impressive: Very steep slopes, all overgrown wit hazelnut bushes. The area I was passing through got wilder and wilder, the population becoming ever more sparse. When I felt quite exhausted going uphill, I came across a "rest area" in the middle of the mountains: a restaurant with many different tables hid away between trees, and even hammocks. I sat down there to rest, to my surprise I got no tea, but water and strawberries. The owner was interested in what I was doing, and handed me his phone. I talked to his friend ***Buddy***, who is living in Istanbul. He is a traveller himself, and has lived in the US for twenty years, therefore speaking the according slang. He immediately ***überschütten*** me with *wonderful*s and *amazing*s, flattering me a lot. He also gave me his number, such that I could call him whenever I needed an interpreter. I had no idea back then how soon I would.

He also recommended me to go to Çambaşı, a village in the highlands close by, where he had grown up. He promised me a landscape like "nothing you have ever seen before". As I was still quite ahead of plan, I had no reason to not have a look. I was not able to talk him out of organizing me someone to drive me up, though. I again got the information that there were "all kinds of animals", and that I should make sure that I had a knife on me for self-defense. I did not mention that if I used a knife, I rather suspected to do myself harm than a possible attacker. Later in the day Ibrahim called, to make sure that there was no problem.

* * *

In the evening I came by a gorgeous reservoir lake, framed by steep slopes covered with woods. Hoping that wild animals are ***sceptical*** of man-made constructions, I put up my tent in a ***Rohbau*** close by, next to the street. The tent is not made to stand without tent anchors, and I had to use ***Mauersteine*** to keep it upright. I had dinner with an amazing view and called friends in Germany. One of them was constantly joking that I should say some code words if I needed someone to get me out of Turkey. I talked to ***buddy*** again, and he told me that he had a house in the village further up the road and that I coul have stayed there if w had talked earlier; however the tent was already set up and I ***scheuen*** to tell the villagers that I was not trespassing, but authorized to sleep in that house.

> ![Campping in a ***Rohbau***](/images/IMG_3669.JPG)

The ***Rohbau*** where I camped was at a junction of the road and it had happened frequently during the evening that cars had stopped to let out or in passengers. When I heard a car stopping and people shouting, I therefore did not take it as something unusual and just ignored it. A little bit later however, I heard many footsteps on the stairs of where I camped, so it was obvious that this had something to do with me. I opened my tent to see around nine men of all ages standing around the tent, staring at me, one glaring me with a huge flashlight. A little bit annoyed, I signaled him to put it down and started telling my usual Turkish keyword story of "Germany -- bicycle -- Iran". They did not disappear, and kept taling to me in Turkish, which I naturally did not understand. I got out of the tent, to not have to talk up to them. They were telling me that they wanted to see my passport, and I told them that this was not going to happen -- neither of them had a uniform, they did not look entitled to me to ask for my passport. When I saw that one of them was carrying a gun, I started feeling uneasy. ***Zu allem Überfluss***, he had the looks of the classical Hollywood ***Bösewicht***-ex-marine: short white hair, blue eyes (cf. Avatar). That was when I reached for my phone and called my buddy in Istanbul. To my delight he picked up the phone and talked to the guys. When I got the phone back he told me that there had been a PKK terrorist attack one year ago in which three soldiers had been killed, just down by the lake, and that these men were village people patrolling for hideaway terrorists. The guy with the gun was the mayor. While he talked to the mayor again, I finally showed the others my passport, no longer caring whether they were authorized, though still not giving it out of my hands. I was in sort of a post-shock state and sat down to calm down. I was given back the phone and my buddy told me that they apologized for having frightened me and asked whether I needed anything -- typical Turks again.

The next day I had a very short trip to get to Mesudiye, where a relative of ***buddy*** has a bar. When I arrived at the town square, it seemed that people already knew I was coming; passengers were waving me over and guiding me the way to the bar. I was welcomed very ***herzlich*** by ***çavaş***, the owner of the bar. He is a ***gemütlich*** man with a warm smile. After some interpreter calls, I sat down in the bar for the afternoon, writing on the blog. The plan according to my English buddy was that someone would take me up to Çambaşı the next day, so I relaxed. I felt very comfortable in the ***urig***, ***holzvertäfelt*** bar. Sometimes someone would come over to ask what I was doing, or ***çaval*** came over to sit with me, but most of the time I was left alone.

> ![Mesudiye by night](/images/IMG_3679.JPG)

I could stay the night with ***Çaval***'s family and slept very well, and was woken the next morning again by ***Çavaş***'s warm smile -- nice way to wake up. They drove me down to the bar, where my bicycle had been locked for the night, and I packed up. Obviously there had been a misunderstanding because there was nobody taking me up by car, but I preferred going up to Çambaşı by bike anyway.

It was a steep and slow climb, but I ended up in a beautiful landscape, not unlike to the Alps. It was barren, yet green. The higher mountains in the distance were looming grey. There was an easily accessible summit close to my road, so I left the bicycle and went up on foot.

> ![View from the summit](/images/IMG_3718 - IMG_3721.jpg)

The view was breathtaking. To the right, there were the lower, wood-covered hills. To my left, there were the high summits of the highlands, some even with patches of snow on them. I enjoyed this sight for some time, and then continued into the direction of Çambaşı a bit. From the top it had looked as if there were plenty roads through the highlands and in the direction I intended to go, but unfortunately they were not on my map, so I ***schweren Herzens*** turned around and descended to Mesudiye again. I arrived there the next morning, said farewell another time to ***Çaval*** and then continued my journey to the south.

> *At the entrance of the gym in which I spent one night*

This is my last night in Croatia, tomorrow I‘m crossing the border to Serbia. Italy was the last country I’ve been to before, since Slovenia every country I come across is completely new to me. After Slovenia seemed pretty much like the western European countries to me, Croatia was different. The cars in the streets were less modern. I think this is a positive thing. It suggests that there is no consummation society and the available resources are used as long as possible. Instead of throwing things away once they suffer some damage, they are repaired and kept until their lifespan is over. More than once I saw people having a second, broken down car of the same make in the backyard, probably for getting spare parts.

In the villages, almost every house was having a garden where people grew crops. Besides some huge and very modern farming vehicles, it was a common sight to see people working in their fields and gardens by hand. Many houses had wells, whether in use or not I can’t tell, but often artfully decorated. Same as the houses, they existed in all states of decay, from taken care of, to nearly broken down. Regarding houses: there were quite a lot obviously inhabited, but only half finished houses. No plaster or isolation, just the raw masonry. Sometimes there were even whole villages of these half-finished houses.

Two times I came across broken down churches. The sight was a bit sad, but it was also fascinating to see how a building disintegrates when left alone against the forces of nature, and sort of romantic. Furthermore, these buildings were freely accessible while in Germany everything around them would have been bordered up and locked down. It seems that people here have more faith in the common sense of their fellow citizens.

Wherever I went, the storks were already there. They seemed to belong to the general picture, each village had at least one. I even came across a village that styled itself “the first stork village”. In general the fauna appeared more diverse and wild to me than what I’m used to. Once a fox was taking its time in crossing the road in front of me, in broad daylight. When it noticed me, it fled, though. I saw different kinds of herons, which I had never seen so many different kinds of out in the wild; I only knew them from books. In one region there were even wild turtles, although I was not so fortunate to come across a living one.

Along the river Sava, there was a very peculiar style of building, and it was impressive how little variation there was. If the houses hadn’t seemed that old and traditional, I would have suspected them to be part of the socialist past, uniform as they were.

Typical building style along Sava in Croatia

These houses were mostly two stories and a roof, very narrow and often with a staircase attached on the right side. They were built of wood, except for the ground floor which was sometimes masonry. The wood beams were interleaved at the corners in a very specific fashion, and the facades sometimes artfully decorated.

Regarding roads, Croatia was the country with the streets going straight to the horizon, going over every hill in between.

There were funny speed limits, sometimes 80 km/h in villages, sometimes 30 km/h on rural roads. Like a law of nature, there were trucks (heavy duty trucks which I only know from motorways) on all roads, no matter how remote or narrow.

There is a Jugoslavian Kofola! I liked Kofola better, though...

I came into Croatia on the height of Zagreb. In Zagreb I did some random sightseeing and took a break in a bar that was frequented by locals to work on the blog. I crossed the northern part of Croatia from the west to the east.

Sava in Croatia

In the beginning I went along the river Sava again. Down here the river seemed to be nearly standing and was surrounded by many bogs. In that context it was somewhat funny that the greeting in Croatia is “bog”. I fled away from the river after an evening with clouds of mosquitos (though the bath in Sava was very pleasant) and continued going east a little bit further north.

I was delighted by the hospitality of the Croatians, there are two encounters I would like to relate in detail.
On the evening of my second night in Croatia, I asked for water at a house. I got it, and the man asked me whether I was hungry. As I had not yet had dinner, I was invited to join their dinner, which I gladly accepted. They were a family with three sons, 16, 15 and about seven years old. The oldest one did most of the talking, as he spoke really good English. The older two brothers reminded me of my older brother and me; the younger one shy and quiet, the older one very self-confident for his age. It was the local elections that day, and I learned a little bit about the structure of the country and the political spectrum. When we had finished eating, I said goodbye in order to look for a camp spot. That was when they invited me to sleep in a spare room they had and to use their shower – this and the invitation for dinner came so completely unexpected that I was completely overwhelmed with gratitude that evening.

When I came across Garešnice two days later, I did some shopping and nearly lost my bicycle key as I had forgotten to close the pocket I keep it in. When I looked up after collecting it, a young man was leaning from the balcony of a café and invited me to have a beer with him and his friends, as they were also cyclist tourers, and he was on Warmshowers. A few moments later I was amidst a jolly crowd of Croatians, urging me on to the second beer.

Žac, who had invited me, recommended me a camp spot on the football field and said I could also have a warm shower there as he is a football coach in his free time. At first I neglected the offer because I hadn’t yet gone too far that day, but a liter of beer later (0.5l is a small beer here, they told me) there was a thunderstorm raging, and my motivation to continue dwindled. Furthermore, the campspot recommendation had turned into an offer to sleep on the floor of the gym, and having a roof over my head seemed a good thing for that night.

My sleeping place in the gym

Feeling quite tipsy, I rolled the last meters to the football court, showered, washed my clothes and had dinner under a roof and with a table; very comfortable. The doormat to my refuge of that night read “do whatever makes you happy”, and I felt I was doing the right thing. Žac returned ater and Damir (the owner of the gym) and him took me for a tour through the village. We went to a bar and talked about cycling, my trip and theirs (they had gone to Athens). When I told them that I was not used to alcohol currently, they laughed and said they were preparing me for Serbia. From Jacques I learned a little bit about the history of the war that broke up Jugoslavia, and that there are mine fields in eastern Croatia. It seems that I didn’t come across any, but that might also be due to the fact that I mostly make camp in spaces where there have obviously been people before me.

Saying farewell to Damir

Leaving Croatia makes me a bit of sad, because I liked the country and its interested, friendly people a lot. Still, after crossing the border, it will only be Serbia and Bulgaria separating me from the Turkish border; I’m looking forward a lot to crossing the imaginary borderline of Europe.

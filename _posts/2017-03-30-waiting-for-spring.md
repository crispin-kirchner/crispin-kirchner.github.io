A door in Freiburg

Reading other cyclist's reports and blogs, it occurred to me that having my own might be a good idea; to keep people posted about my progress, but perhaps also as a convincing argument when dealing with immigration issues along the way. Right now I am still at home, getting hardware, papers and vaccinations; don't be confused by the pictures, they are placeholders from former tours, scheduled departure is end of April. Right now I'm fixing my bike, getting gear and clothes and soon do a test-ride. The first visa I will need along is the one to Iran. As each visa has a starting date, I will get this on the way. I wouldn't like the idea of getting it beforehand, as I want to stay flexible during the trip and don't want to impose myself fixed time frames. All can. Nothing should.

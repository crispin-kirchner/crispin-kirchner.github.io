Proper borders (well, it’s only the second for me) still intimidate me; with the officers and controls. Where I crossed over to Serbia, the Danube is the border – since I had last seen it (a stream which I could wade through), it had grown considerably; now it was a huge river. In Serbia my passport got the first stamp of its still short life. It does not say which country, however; only the date I entered and the name of the border checkpoint, including a small car pictogram. It seems that there are no stamps for cyclists. Short before the border I got the pleasant surprise of a long call from friends from Magdeburg. After receiving the usual “welcome to Serbia” message from my network provider, I realized how lucky I had been to have gotten that call just then – in Serbia, meaning outside the EU, the roaming prices are at a level which I knew only from horror stories my parents told me when I was a kid. I was delighted to find that the street signs were written in Cyrillic and in Latin, allowing me to refresh and deepen my knowledge of Cyrillic writing. The border is not only something to cross, it is also visible. Right after going over Danube, I was no longer the only cyclist on the road – by far. A moped driver riding an ancient model stopped next to me, refilled his petrol tank from a bottle and continued again. Also, the streets were suddenly filled with Zastavas and Yugos – cars formerly produced in Jugoslavia. All of these cars are 30 years and older, but obviously taken care of by their owners. The Zastava plant was destroyed during the bombing of Serbia by the NATO during the decay of Jugoslavia; it was rebuilt after the war and is now operated by Fiat. In the beginning it seems that the commercial vehicles were still carrying the Zastava labels – at least there are some transporters on the road which I recognize as Fiat or Iveco makes, but branded as Zastava.

As I was told by my Serbian colleague in Sweden, Serbs prefer the Euro to their own currency, the Dinar. Therefore in the whole country there are Мењашница (exchange offices) in each bigger village. The lady at the counter was surprised that I wanted to exchange my Croatian Kunas, it seemed that the only foreign currency normally handled is Euro. She also told delighted me with the news that the Croatian and Serbian language are nearly the same. However, when I asked her whether I can continue to use the greeting “bog”, she made clear with gestures, mimic and words that I should never ever use that word in Serbia.

The last town before the Serbian border, Osijek, surprised me. There was a beautiful main square, and a long road of picturesque mansions; it seems to have been important in the past. As always, I am attracted by the brutalist architecture of socialist living quarters, and I also found a stadium which seemed like the definition of brutalist architecture to me (having said that, I think it’s necessary to indicate that I actually have no idea of architecture to judge that). Being close to the border, the city also carries the scars of the Croatian-Serbian separation; many buildings are pock-marked with bullet holes.

I was educated with war as an abstract terror from the past, made visible by memorials and  illustrated in museums. Cycling through this city was quite a contrast to that. War is nothing abstract here: it is real, not long ago and there is no real need for monuments as long as the consequences are that plainly visible. There was still one I liked a lot, of a Zastava conquering a tank. However that might also be an older one erected in the socialist past.

In Serbia I yielded. In Osijek, I had started looking for spare gas canisters for my cooker. I have a cooker that needs threaded canisters, which are sort of a standard for high quality outdoor cookers. That means they are typically available in stores that sell outdoor- and camping gear. I therefore asked in shops, malls and the tourist information office where I would find such a store. My question was deliberately not whether there was a store, but where. What a fruit of ignorance! In big supermarkets and DIY markets there were piercing canisters available, and canisters with the proprietary Campingaz docking system, but no threaded canisters. I came to realize that there were simply no outdoor equipment stores in that region. As there was still some gas in the canister, I postponed my search to Нови Сад, the next big city in Serbia, where I was sure to find something. Ignorance, again!

Asking people where I could find an outdoor equipment store, I often had to first explain what that is. I heard later that it is not easy to leave Serbia due to the passport, which explains why holiday gear is not important here. After a lot of asking I used an open WiFi to search the internet for an outdoor store; the result was: no outdoor stores in Нови Сад, but a “Camping Center” and a branch of an online shop in Београд – On I rolled, with high hopes.
Again I liked the rough charm of the living quarters a lot. Some of the houses reminded me of how the Burrow, the home of family Weasley in the Harry Potter Books, is described. The way they are built, like a pile of individual living quarters stacked together, it seemed indeed that these buildings, same as the Burrow, are only kept together by magic.

Coming across Danube again meant crossing the Danube cycling route from time to time. One day I met two Swiss girls cycling to the black sea, who had started in Davos only a few days later than I had been there; but as they went through Hungary while I went through Italy, Slovenia and Croatia, our tracks hadn’t crossed before. The two were leading all the concerns my parents had expressed about me taking my old bike completely ad absurdum – one of the two was cycling on an ancient bicycle, while the other had a bicycle like mine. I was impressed a lot by their courage to do such a trip with this hardware, and even more when I heard that they were not carrying tools; I therefore forced some of my cable ties on them; so far the most useful spare part I had had with me.

When cooking my lunch that day I decided to sit in the shadow of the trees in front of a house. The owner signaled me that he was OK with that and I started chopping the vegetables. When I started to cook the noodles, the flame dwindled when the water was still far away from boiling – there was no chance to get the noodles edible, not even by soaking them really long. I therefore resorted to asking the man who had allowed me to cook on his front lawn whether he could cook my noodles on his stove, which he luckily did. It was a quite funny situation overall.

Later that day I followed the Danube cycling route on a completely absurd deviation: the route left a perfectly cyclable main road, to go own along the steep banks of the river, on tiny roads of mediocre quality; even downhill I only went at walking pace. Yet I am still very grateful for this detour, because I got invited by a family to have a Rakija (schnapps) with them in their garden. The father and mother spoke good English and translated for the granddad, who had been the one inviting me. The father is also computer scientist, and works as a teacher at a primary school (if the school system is similar to the Croatian one, primary school covers the first eight years of school).

The capital is unexpectedly hilly; after having gone through the plains for a long time, I was surprised to not only have to cope with traffic chaos, but with steep uphill traffic chaos. The facades of the houses along the main streets were black from the sot of the exhaust fumes. Over the roofs of the city I could see the huge domed silhouette of the Church of Saint Sava, which I unfortunately did not come across later; reason enough to visit Belgrade again!

At the address of the first outdoor store I found a supermarket. On the way to the second, a young Serb warns me not to tell people that I’m German, though I’m not convinced by his reasoning; also because most people I met so far were very friendly and often even spoke some German and seemed happy to showcase it. Shortly later this experience was repeated: Going north (and up) through the city, the noises dwindled and I was suddenly in a nice park, quiet and above the city, with benches and tables in the shadow of the trees. While looking for a place to have my lunch, I got invited for food and a beer by a group of Serbians enjoying their afternoon there. I asked a lot of questions about the history of Jugoslavia and the wars which had led to its separation. The Serbs in turn wanted to know what the Croatians told me about Serbia and were happy to hear that the only warning I got was that I would have to drink a lot of alcohol there. They also suggested me to just buy a stove for piercing canisters if I shouldn’t find a replacement for my threaded canisters. They said that I would find such in “the chinese stores”. Indeed, while looking and asking for the threaded canisters, I had found out that piercing canisters are available almost everywhere in Serbia. When I asked how I could recognize such a “chinese store”, I was told to look for a store with many different goods on sale.

I got turned down by the “Belgrade Camping Center” as well (the house number was not known to any of the locals, and indeed where it should have been, there were no houses along the road). When I started looking for the “chinese stores”, I came to realize that it is not only what people call them, but that this is kind of a brand around Belgrade; the shops were literally labeled by their owners as “кинеска радња” (kineska radnja). I got a cheap yellow cooker. Cheap means dirt cheap: my Swedish high-tech cooker, which is the cheapest cooker for threaded canisters (no canisters included) costs the same as 45 piercing canisters plus the cheap cooker. I still regret not being able to use my old cooker any more; the new one heats not only the pot, but also the surroundings and is even with a wind shield still strongly affected by wind; most likely it wastes 50% of the gas. I still celebrated the purchase with a cup of tea in the evening.

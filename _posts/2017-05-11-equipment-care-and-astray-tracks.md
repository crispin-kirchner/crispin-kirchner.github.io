Cycling down the river Inn is harder than expected. Although I slept exceptionally long, even the slightest ascend is too much for me to take. On the other side of the valley, the railway runs along over many beautiful bridges. I seem to be on Romansh territory now – the signs along the road are in a language that does not look like Italian. In Scuol, I spend my last Swiss Francs because I am likely to arrive in Austria today. In my current constitution however, I don’t plan to take on the Reschenpass that day.

For lunch, I cook a huge portion of curry that nearly fills my whole pot – with the pleasant effect that I’m feeling completely regenerated after lunch and make good progress. In Martina, the border town between Switzerland and Austria, I ask locals where Martina is. Already being there is a pleasant surprise; I had thought it would be some more kilometers uphill.

After a short break I am doing what I wouldn’t have thought possible – I’m going up my old friend Reschenpass. Compared to the experience the day before this one feels like a piece of cake – no traffic, warm weather, no wind, only really slight ascends. On the way up I notice that the headset of my bike is loose – and remember the words of my bike mechanic: “you should have it tightened after 50-100km.” That was at least 500km ago. But as I am on a popular bicycle route I don’t worry about it too much, as I expect to find bicycle workshops in the villages.

On the top I meet Rainer with the recumbent bike. He lives in Reschen. He extends my knowledge about the Tyrolian-Italian relationship, I learn about the penstock of the lake Reschen power plant and that the old village of Graun has been demolished and is not still inside the lake. Shortly after the pass I sleep on the lawn of a sympathetic farmer and for the first time wash in a river. It’s terribly cold, but I can crawl into my cozy sleeping bag and have a hot tea shortly after.

The next day I get to know all the diversity of bicycle stores of the Vinschgau. In the first they look for the right tools for a very long time, are finally able to tighten the headset, but don’t have the tools to lock it. After they tell me that they previously only serviced skiing equipment and just started servicing bicycles, I decide to try the next store. There they have the correct tools, but they are pretty worn and they have the apprentice attempt the repair – I’m fleeing the scene with a still unlocked headset. In the third store again the tools are not available – seems like nobody in this valley ever saw a threaded headset; although these have been and still are the standard on most bikes. The last store I stop by seems and is competent, but fixes much more than I asked for and charges way more than I expected. I still pay it without complaint as he is the one who solves my problem; still I’m left with the unpleasant feeling of having been ripped off.

I pass through Meran that day and witness a strange scene: An excavator is standing on an island in the river Etsch. Besides the question how it got there, its operator seems to be digging away the very island that keeps him from being flushed away by the stream.

I have strong tailwinds that day and even overtake some other cyclists in spite of my luggage – that never happened so far. The mountains along the valley seem more savage than in the parts I have been to before. They are steeper, more overgrown and there are less houses to be seen on the slopes. The valleys to the side are narrow end cut deep into the rocks; they are also covered in dense forests.

> ![Vinschgau](/images/img_2134.jpg)

Finding a farmer in this rich region who allows me to sleep on his field turns out to be hard. In the end I decide to camp in the wild, somewhere along the slopes of the valley, so I go up a road that’s so steep that I can’t do better than pushing the bike. I glance a farmer caring for his vines and ask him. He says yes so straight away that I’m taken aback and overwhelmed by gratitude. As I put up the tent I hear the rods making an unpleasant cracking noise for the second time – it becomes clear that the tent also wants some attention after the bike got so much. I prepare to spend most of the next day in Bozen to find a replacement.

On my arrival, it happens to me for the first time on my trip that someone does not speak German. Getting the tent rod is an expectedly hard endeavor. At Sportler Alpin, they are willing to help and search their warehouse, but can’t find a rod of the right diameter. At Mountain Spirit they just don’t care and tell me to ask the producer of the tent for a spare part. They don’t even check whether they have something lying around. Calling the dealers of my tent’s producer in the near range yields many unanswered calls and finally the information that all southern Europe is no longer supplied by this brand, hence no spare parts. My German dealer says they have all the parts, but need the sizes of the rods. I therefore return to Sportler Alpin, as they had measuring equipment. While I measure, Toni goes to the warehouse a second time and returns with better matching rods than before, but still no usable ones. We check with a Salewa tent he has for sale and see that the rods in that tent are exactly the ones I need. He then calls the Salewa headquarter, which is luckily located in Bozen, and they allow me to drop by. After cycling through half the city and waiting for a long time, I leave the Salewa workshop with new rods, two more spare rods of the correct diameter, and a hint for a nice cycle route out of the valley and to the east, along the demolished railway line of the former “Dolomiten-Express”. All of this came at zero cost. I will definitely buy equipment from Salewa with a very positive feeling in the future.

After asking some locals for the way to this “ferrovia vecchia”, among them four old men sitting in at a gas station’s bar and drinking wine, I’m on the slightly (2%) ascending track, away from the beaten path. That night I camp between apple trees way above the valley floor, and can see the lights down there from the entry of my tent.

The next day I need to do some shopping before I can have breakfast. I break up camp early and ride up into the next village. The supermarket also seems to be the social heart and meeting point of the city, the clerks and clients are exchanging news. The boss is really interested in my trip and asks me many questions, while watching the spectacle of me strapping all my bags onto my bike. After saying goodbye, I swing onto my bike, but hear that something is clinking inside the spokes. Thinking that I hadn’t tucked away one of the straps properly, I look back. To my astonishment I see that the right rod supporting the luggage carrier has broken and that the whole thing is now shaking quite badly. After taking down all the luggage again I take out the most important gear I have with me: My tools, spare spokes, cable ties and duct tape. Two spokes are cut in half, the four parts stuck around the cracked parts and the whole thing lashed up with the cable ties. I’m both surprised and happy about how sturdy the whole thing looks and decide that I will make it to Cavalese like that. A passer-by is interested in what I am doing there, sitting on the ground. Without even touching the construction to check it, he confers the rather unqualified, but welcome verdict: “That will hold.” He also tells me that there definitely is a bicycle store in Cavalese, where I can get a replacement carrier. I end up having breakfast very late and in eyesight of the place I spent the night.

The route continues as it started: slight ascend, nice bridges and tunnels. I decide to try putting on the soundtrack of lord of the rings. This leads to me going into a tunnel with broken lighting along with the Nazgûl theme – instant shivering and the urgent need to get out of the darkness again. If you are audio-sensitive as me, I can’t recommend motion picture soundtracks for cycling ;-)

After one day of sobriety I finally see snow-capped mountains again; what a beauty. From Cavalese on I exchange the Austrian “Servus” with “Ciao” – people seem to speak Italian here, which means that I finally crossed the language barrier. Luckily Italians roughly understand what I mean when I talk Spanish to them; most people I meet here don’t speak English. In the tourist office in Predazzo I get a map with the passes on and start going up the Paso Rolle. There are many racing cyclists doing their home time round up the mountain and I get many encouraging thumbs-ups. I come across a nearly empty reservoir lake, down on the ground some boulderers are climbing. I camp on a clearing in a beautiful forest halfway up the pass, at around 1400m. Washing in the river has become the habit, although the cold still bites the feet.

The next day I spontaneously decide to take the north-eastern Passo Valles instead of the south-eastern Paso Rolle. The pass is demanding, but I am rewarded with spectacular outlooks on the harsh rock walls opposite me.

I’m going downhill bit by bit, finally reaching Agordo. The tourist information is closed as usual, but a shop selling miniature models has a detailed topographical map of the whole alps hanging outside. While I study it, the owner comes out and tells me about his own cycle tours. He used to cycle to Helsinki with his wife. He recommends me to take the abandoned and forbidden old country road going parallel to a tunnel of 2km further down the road. As the traffic is quite heavy, I am very grateful for the hint. The abandoned road has a barrier that’s not too easy to undergo with the loaded bike, but it’s possible with a sideways bicycle limbo. A little bit further the road forks onto a slender and high bridge.

> ![The bridge the old road forks onto](/images/img_2214.jpg)

As I know that this road is unmaintained, and so the bridge, I assume that I should go on straight, otherwise the shop owner would have mentioned it. So I go along an enchanted old road, covered with some debris from the rock walls above, but mainly covered with many plants and trees growing out of the concrete, nature retaking control over the place.

> ![Nature retaking control over the concrete](/images/img_2217.jpg)

The overgrowth becomes quite thick from time to time, but is still traversable. I start asking myself how long ago my tipster saw this road the last time. After a particularly nasty bit with many needle trees only slightly smaller than me scratching me while passing through them, I come across a stretch where the road is completely covered in boulders and debris and not crossable.

> ![Sudden rubble](/images/img_2218.jpg)

Thinking about the alternative being a 2km tunnel with many trucks and cars, I unpack all the luggage from my bike, carry everything over the pile, and put it on on the other side. This procedure takes about 15 to 20 minutes. I continue further along, but soon come to a spot where the road just ends and there is only impassible overgrowth ahead. Witch clenched teeth I return, again go over the dump of rocks, again unloading and loading all the bags and carrying over the parts individually. Feeling defeated I come to the conclusion that it is either the highly trafficked tunnel or the unmaintained bridge, yet I feel that I won’t take the risk of the bridge. Still, I am afraid of the tunnel. As I reach the bridge, in the saddle anyways, I just drive over it. A little bit surprised about myself, my heart starts bumping harder as I am at the center of the bridge, and I try increasing my speed all the way, to get over there as fast as possible – and then I’m suddenly on the other side. Relieved that I was not the final straw that broke the bridge’s neck, I’m saying to myself: “That was reckless.” The bridge is about 50m high, going over a narrow gorge. The following 2km are going downhill on a perfect, not overgrown road and within minutes I reach a bridge, leading to the main road again, at the exit of the tunnel. Only this time it is a flat bridge passing the river in some three meters height.

After joining the traffic again, I meet Jorge from Peru. Same as me, he thinks that the Alps here closely resemble the Andes around Machu Picchu – dense vegetation and uninhabiteed, steep slopes.

> ![Jorge from Peru](/images/img_2221.jpg)

He has been working in Rome for some months and now has one month of holiday which he spends on bikeback. He wants to go to Switzerland and back. His bike is a racing bike equipped with a luggage carrier. He has a beer with him and offers me a sip, which tastes really good after many days of cycling. I leave him the map I used for the past two days, as it’s no longer of any use for me, and tell him how to circumvent the tunnel – being explicit about the bridges. For him this detour is most likely even more valuable than it was for me – I wouldn’t like going uphill for 2km inside a dark and narrow tunnel. I camp in a forest that night, cooking my dinner from inside the tent, being cozy and warm while it is raining outside.

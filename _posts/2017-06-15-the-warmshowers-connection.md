The next day in Edirne, we had a quick breakfast and then went to have another look at the city when there was daylight, planning to go cycling again after lunch. I wanted to go see the bridge we had seen when cycling into Edirne from closer. In fact it was two bridges, spanning two arms of the same river. Both are built in the same fashion, one shorter, one longer. The one we had seen from far was the longer one. They are quite narrow, such that two cars can pass by each other, but only if the pedestrians evade onto one of the narrow sidewalks.

As Maik's handlebar was quite low, and he was therefore getting lots of strain on his wrists, we were also trying to find an extension to his fork's tube, such that the handlebar would be higher. We had seen this on the bike of the German cyclist coming from China, back in Sofia. On the way back we stopped at a shop selling used bicycles and parts. He didn't have something close to what we were looking for, but called a different store in Edirne for us, to check whether they had. Fortunately this store was on our way out of the city, so we went back to the hostel, wrote some postcards, had lunch and then got on the bikes again.

The store was run by bicycle enthusiasts. While a fork extension is something one has to look for for quite some time, they even had multiple types to choose from. We spent quite some time there, talking to the owner while Maik's fork was getting the extension fitted. He told us that the shop itself had a WarmShowers profile and offered us to stay another night; we declined as we wanted to continue. While we stood there and talked, other touring cyclists approached the shop. They were three French people, a couple and a solo cyclist. I had already heard rumors about the couple from other touring cyclists in Serbia: they went on a tandem, on which the front position was like on a recumbent bike, while the rear position was normal sitting. They were really nice, we chatted all together, about our trips, how we came, what damages we had had on the bikes. They even gave Maik and me a test ride on the front position of the tandem. It was a rare gathering, five touring cyclists in one place was a record so far.

There were some difficulties with the repair, and because the shop people were nice they also greased Maik's brake strings -- in the end everything took quite a while. So when we were getting ready to leave again, it was already 4pm. We shortly considered our options: either cycling for two hours and camping somewhere, or staying and having a longer break; the decision was easy. As I had programmed most of the night before at the hostel, I was completely done and very tired, so we asked whether we could stay for the night. We were led into an apartment that seemed to serve three purposes: living, hosting touring cyclists and as a shop warehouse. The numerous guests had all left messages on the kitchen tiles.

I slept well that night, although I was a little bit scared that the wall of bicycles next to my mattress might fall over during the night. But fortunately nothing happened.

The next morning, we had a tea with our host in the shop. He told us that they had started as a cycling café and then started the shop, and he was very eager to get us places to sleep at for the next two nights. So before we left, he had already organized us something to sleep in Lüleburgaz, and recognized us a WarmShowers host for the day after that. We left, very grateful.

# The Road to Istanbul

That day we did not take a nice route over the villages as before, but decided to go for the fast lane: the D100. We did this to check out how it was to ride on the D roads in Turkey, but also because Maik's setup had changed, it was reasonable to go for an easy and short route that day. In spite of the traffic, the roads are a nice way to go, as there is a wide hard shoulder one can ride safely on. I felt it was a little bit frustrating to have such a monotonous route; the landscape was only changing slowly and the road kept going up and down always in the same fashion, very boring and very exhausting on the long run.

When we stopped at a supermarket, we experienced Turkish hospitality once again: Without further comment, a man delivering goods to the supermarket gave a package of ice cream to Maik.

Our host in Edirne had given us the address of a shop in Lüleburgaz where we should go in order get accommodation. Arriving there, we were surprised to see that it was not another bicycle shop, but rather a shop selling a little bit of everything. All we had to do was stand in front of it, some moments later we were greeted with "Welcome! Do you want to sleep in Lüleburgaz?" After affirming, the guy got his bicycle and led us through the city to the "Academy" -- a course for learning to ride a bicycle, with hills, bumps and different curves.

He talked to the guard, and some phone calls later we were showed a room which was obviously built for the exact purpose of hosting touring cyclists. The room had four wooden boxes as furniture, which served as a bed when one put a sleeping mat on top. And there were multiple showers! On the downside, the building was very modern architecture -- it was not possible to open windows, therefore the air was quite stuffy. I only found out the next morning that the air conditioning could also have been used to ventilate the place with fresh (outside) air.

After moving in and showering, we went for a walk through the city and ended up in a café where there was WiFi. Now that my ticket *into* Iran was glued into my passport, I had started thinking about the outward ticket as well. As I have not flown much in my life so far, never long distances, and also not with a bicycle, it was comforting to have Maik sitting next to me. He had flown a lot and I could clear most doubts by quickly asking. That way I booked a flight on the end of August, with an Iranian airline. As the baggage allowance is ridiculously high (30kg and 1.58m), I am quite confident that I will take the bicycle back home with me. The price was good, and most important it's a direct flight from Tehran to Munich -- no stopovers which would increase my anxiety about my luggage. In the evening I also started writing to shared flats in my future home, Berne.

For navigating, we had lately used Maik's navigation software. It took long to compute the route, but in the end it led us mostly over nicely cyclable roads with few traffic. After the experience of the D100 the day before, we decided to go back to this more pleasant cycling mode. In the village where we stopped for lunch, we were treated with exceptional hospitality. First, the owner of the supermarket gave each of us a lemonade for free. When we sat on the ground in front of a closed restaurant, a man came along and opened it up for us, such that we could sit at tables to eat. Shortly afterwards, a German came round to pay us a visit. He had lived in Germany since 1970 and just two years ago had come back to Turkey, where he was born. His son is the mayor of a village close to Stuttgart. He invited us for tea in the café on the opposite side of the road. I declined because I was having stomach problems and suspected that they were related to the unusual amounts of black tea I had been consuming since we had entered Turkey. Maik went with him, while I used the break for writing on the blog. When I looked up a little bit later, I was somewhat discomforted to see that Maik was no longer in the café opposite, drinking tea. While I was still wondering how to react when your cycling buddy has been kidnapped, he reappeared. He related to me how the man had taken him to his home, and introduced the whole family, including the son-mayor. Maik had had to drink even more tea, and was shown the crops that the family grew by themselves.

On the road again, it happened ever more often that the route computation of Maik crashed. All along, I started missing my "old" way of navigating, using the compass without really knowing where I was going. I had started to think about separating from Maik after we would have reached Istanbul, to get back my independence and get rid of being the one trailing behind. When we later took a wrong turn, Maik told me something about a "detour of 50km" and seemed to think about going back to the place where we had missed a turn. The word "detour" sort of flicked a switch inside me -- my philosophy of being on the road had always been to just enjoy, and to not believe in detours, as each meter of the road had proven to be valuable so far. Furthermore, the junction where we were standing had a road going perfectly east; just where we wanted to go. Fed up with discussing about where we went next, I decided that this was the road I would have taken if I would have been alone, and left Maik standing there. When he caught up again, we had a short exchange of our main concerns. As I knew, Maik wanted to be in Georgia in the middle of July, while I just wanted to travel by bike, without too many fixed time frames. Especially, it did not make sense for me to be in Iran too early, as this would mean the hassle of organizing a visa extension. Long story short, we agreed that our traveling styles did not match well on the long run. Funny enough, Maik told me that he had been thinking about splitting up after Istanbul -- same as me. With this new goal in mind, it was easier for me to accept the way we were navigating, and I was determined to fully enjoy the coming last days with Maik.

The officials on the Azeri side of the border were very polite and friendly and made me feel very welcome. One could tell that it was also for them a rare sight to have a cyclist ante portas. One of them spoke some English and helped me through the whole process. They actually checked the stamps in my passport, and looked for a long time for the Turkish entry stamp, even asking whether I had a second passport. When I showed them the paper with the entry stamp, they were satisfied. I had to smile when they asked why I had spent so much time in Turkey.

I could exchange my money straight at the border post. The exchange office consisted of a man with Turkish Lira in his left- and Azeri Manad in his right pocket. The design of the bills carries some similarities to the Euro notes.

The land right after the border post was dusty and barren, but that changed soon afterwards: at least along the main road, the plains of Nakhchivan are watered with a network of pipes and channels, making it a very green, fertile land; sometimes even to the limit of swampiness.

To the right (west) of the main road, a wide plain stretches to the border of Iran. Behind it, huge mountains loom. To the left, the Zangzegur Mountains rise, with the Armenian border hidden somewhere inside them. Immediately after the border it became quiet. The honking was far less than in Turkey. Either there is a law against pointlessly blowing the horn in Azerbaijan, or maybe it was just some self-fulfilling prophecy of mine, or maybe there was just less traffic -- whatever it was, I felt more relaxed riding on the Nakhchivan roads.

The most palpable difference had already been visible on the Turkish side of the border: cars. It seemed that Nakhchivan people got their cars over cheaper trading routes than in Turkey, as big sedans, often of German make, characterize the streetscape. What made Nakhchivan particularly interesting was that both the Turkish, as well as the Russian influence was noticeable. One of the cars I saw the most was one I had never seen before: Волга sedans. And in reminiscence to the weeks I spent in southeast Europe, there were also numerous Ladas in the streets. Also, I was frequently asked whether I spoke Russian, which seems to be the most important foreign language here.

In the evening, I camped on a willow a little bit off the main road. Thanks to the watering channels, I had a very pleasant shower and could do my laundry. I watched the sun tinting the Zangzegur Mountains orange while I had dinner, when a farmer boy came along to collect the cattle. He immediately got out his phone with Google Translate, and invited me to his family's home. He (Rashad) told me that they had a guitar, so I was eager to come with him.

Arriving there, I was asked whether I wanted to drink beer. They then went to a supermarket and put a 1l bottle of beer in front of me -- quite a challenge for someone who only drinks beer occasionally. However it was the kind I like most: beer from the region, produced somewhere in Nakhchivan. Fortunately they did not seem to expect me to finish it. Very late in the night, we had dinner together. It was delicious: meat, vegetables and bread, seasoned with coriander. Rashad and me took turns in playing the guitar and singing, however I could not really hold a candle to him. It was a great, laid-back atmosphere, they made me feel like I was a family member of them. They invited me to come with them to the village wedding the next day.
When I wanted to say farewell to go to my tent, they led me to a readily prepared bed in the living room, so I only went to the tent to gather my things.

It was evident that the whole village already knew I was their guest; after breakfast the next morning, suddenly the police officer sat at the table to check my passport and visa. Due to the wedding invitation, I for the first time on my journey felt the urgent need of shaving. Family Kmlv felt the same, and the father made an appointment for me at the barber. Somewhere close to Şərur, Nakhchivan, I got the first professional beard cut of my life -- and the barber wanted no money for it.

When I told them what my job was, I got the usual question of whether I could fix their computer. It has been some time since I did this on a regular basis, but I was delighted to be able to show them my gratitude for their hospitality by helping them in something I was good at. Unfortunately the motherboard of the computer was broken, but they had a second computer which also had some flaws, and I was able to build one working computer out of two broken ones.

After the wedding, I went to have tea with Ali and his friend. We stopped by a tire workshop, where they left the entirely worn tire to be fixed, such that the spare tire, which still had a very good profile, could go back into the trunk. It was clearly visible that the Mercedes E-Class in which we were going was the pride of his friend. Ali was the elder son and just visiting the family. He lives in the capital of Azeri mainland, Baku, and works as a fashion designer.

When I set out on the bike again after the one day of break with family Kmlv, it felt to me as though I was starting another bicycle trip. I had felt very at home the last two nights.
After the police was informed about me continuing, I was finally allowed to hit the road. It was very hot that day, and I rode to the capital of the autonomous republic, to have a look.

Approaching the city, mount Ilandag appeared out of the haze. It is a very distinctive peak, and therefore one of the landmarks of Nakhchivan. According to the legend, the notch in its ridge was caused by Noah's ark.

I first had an ice-cream and a break in the shadow, and then went up a monumentally decorated hill, offering a good view over the city. The sunlight was very intense, and I was moving slowly.

Riding through the city, I arrived at a mosque. I wanted to have a look at it from the inside, but things were turning out differently. I met a friendly man in the courtyard, who invited me to come into a tearoom in the mosque. Entering the air-conditioned room felt like entering a fridge. We were essentially talking with hands and feet, but soon had two waiters with us. One spoke a little bit of English and interpreted for the other two. I learned that the temperature that day was 47°C -- so *that* was the reason why everything felt a little bit slower today.

Having seen what the countryside and the villages were like, the city of Nakhchivan felt very artificial. The roads were deserted, and all buildings were in good shape, many being quite new -- very contrary to the back country. It felt a little bit like a ghost town of fancy buildings.

I camped at the outskirts of the city, hidden by trees and bushes. Although I had all the privacy I could wish for, I did not feel too comfortable. However, it was nothing unusual that I from time to time just did not feel like camping, especially after such a pleasant break. When I awoke the next morning, the feeling of not wanting this anymore was still present. Now *this* was something entirely new. So far on the tour, such feelings had been short whims, but seeing that it continued even overnight, I realized that it was time to change something. Crossing the city again in the direction of the Iranian border, I stopped by in the five-star hotel that was located in the city center. They allowed me to use the WiFi in their lobby, so I wrote some couch requests for the coming nights, to flee the tent. I also mused a bit on going straight to Tehran and taking an earlier flight, instead of taking the many detours I had planned for Iran, to the Caspian Sea and Kurdistan

Continuing, it had become slightly windy again and the road went uphill a bit, so I was not breaking any speed records that day. That was OK, as to not have to extend the Iran visa, I would have to spend another night in Nakhchivan. When the border city came into sight, it was already the late afternoon. Unfortunately, the wind was now blowing very hard and awakened memories of the camping debacle short before Iǧdır in Turkey. A little bit off the road and downhill, I found a spot where the wind was not blowing as strong, and where the ground gave a good hold to the tent anchors. When I had set the tent, the wind was increasing however. Going to sleep, the wind was rattling very hard at the tent walls, and I had to discover that the ground was good in keeping the heat of the day. Even after sundown, it was heating from below. The isolation mattress helped reducing that effect a bit, still it was very hot in the tent. The noises of my tent fighting against the wind were deafening, and I found it hard to relax enough to sleep, as the tent was moving so much that I feared that something would rip or that even one of the tent rods might give way. A little bit later I discovered that four tent anchors had been ripped out by the wind again, and I went outside to put a heavy rock on each anchor, such that they would not move again during the night. Luckily, there were enough such rocks in the vicinity.

Even with that reinforcement, it took me a long while to fall asleep. My sleep was light, I woke up very often, anxious for the tent. The heat did its part for keeping me awake as well, I was sweating just from lying around. At four in the morning I finally decided to call it a night, and got up. Rolling up the mattress I noticed that the ground was still heating from below. It felt like I had been sleeping on a giant stove.

Getting up that early, the sun was not yet up and the temperatures were very pleasant. I started to wonder whether the border might have some opening hours, but when I arrived there at 7am, it was open. The officials were again very friendly, the one at the baggage check even wanted the address of my blog. Putting the exit stamp in my passport was taking ages for no apparent reason, creating a long queue of waiting people behind me. I was too tired to care, however. After having been in an upright, half-asleep state for some time, I suddenly found myself on bikeback again, riding over River Aras, from Julfa (Azerbaijan) to Jolfa (Iran), into a new world.

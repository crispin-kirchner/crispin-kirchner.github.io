Back in Sweden, I had a very wise colleague, who is working on his PhD. One day during lunch, many of us were sitting together, and we chatted about how things in life never got easier. His very optimistic opinion was, that *hardship*, how he called it, was just a part of life and that we were in the progress of learning to cope with it. He compared it to eating. He remembered us how it must have been when we were children, having to hold the spoon, balance the food on it, stay concentrated such that nothing fell off while we slowly guided it towards our mouth. Back then, we all had to consciously think about every component of this complicated movement, while right now we were now sitting together, doing it all automated, having a chat while eating. His point was that coping with hardship was something conscious which caused us lots of trouble right now, but that we would practice it, equally to eating with the spoon, until it became an automatism. This in mind, I expected to experience some more hardship to cope with on my journey. However, so far there has been next to nothing of it -- cycling each day comes far less hard than writing a thesis. So, hardship did not come along by itself when cycling, but I succeeded in producing it out of thin air -- completely self-inflected, and therefore with all the more reason to get it out of the way myself. This is why this post is called *Hardship*.

Back in Istanbul, we had to get up very early in the morning, in order to catch the ferry. Istanbul showed itself from a very pleasant side: There was no traffic on our way there, the roads deserted, and we got to the port free of stress and way ahead of time. This was a good thing, as there was again the cumbersome but ineffective (we had knives and again multiple gas canisters in our luggage) safety check, which meant we had to take off all the luggage from the bikes in order to pass it through the scanners. We took a nap during the crossing. The coast on the other side of the Marmaran Sea was lined with hotel sky-scrapers down to the shore. The city seemed deserted, it gave the impression that it was only built for tourists and we were out of season.

Maik and me had a short, tearless farewell, then Maik set off first; if I would have gone first we would have met again straight away. With a festive gesture, I took out my compass again and took the road that led east -- the coastal route. There was a steady up and down, and at the first occasion where the shore was accessible, I took a bath. I have to admit that I did only use the compass for the first half of the day, then never again. I had gotten accustomed so much to using the map that I could see the advantages of knowing where I was going. And I still did not have to plan too much long-term in spite of using the map. One more thing I took over from our joint time was structure -- Maik had had a very good inner clock such that we never ended up looking for a tent spot too late and never had lunch too late in the afternoon, as it had happened to me often while being alone. I therefore set two alarms each day: one for lunch and one for camping.

Doing my groceries that day was an unpleasant experience. The shop clerk spoke quite decent English, and when he learned that I am from Germany, he proudly showed me his Swastika wristband. I backed away and asked whether he thought that was funny. His reply was no, but that he liked Hitler. My question of how it is possible to like someone who was responsible for the death of 6 million people was left unanswered, he cowardly excused himself by saying that his English was not sufficient to discuss that. He elucidated however that Germans only disliked Hitler because of Jewish media -- I then stopped talking to him. He said goodbye to me with a Nazi salute. I had never seen this in real life, only in movies, and it gave me a chill down the spine.

South of the Marmaran Sea it was absolutely necessary to go on concrete roads. The ground here was like clay; after a rainfall it seemed to take several days to dry, and there was rain every other day. While the ground was wet, it would stick immediately to everything that touched it: If I wore my flip-flops and made the error to step outside the concrete, they were twice as heavy when I lifted them again, stepping a second time made them so heavy that I had to fear their strings would tear. With the bike it was even worse: the ground stuck to the tires, such that the wheels blocked. More than once I had to remove the mud with my hands in order to get the bike moving again. It soon became a best practice to remove the luggage from the bicycle on the road, before going camping, because the amount of mud that stuck to the tires seemed to be proportional to the axle weight. I was still lucky to have this kind of ground while being in Turkey; in each village there are public fountains for washing, which came in handy as well to clear the mud from the bicycle.

In the last days I was having issues with sitting on the bike. It was nothing new for me; There was a spot next to my left sit bone, where something painful used to appear, disappear and reappear over the last years, and it was slowly becoming a nuisance again while riding the bike. In addition, I had to get internet for having the shared flat interview, so I decided to take a longer break while crossing Pamukova. Naturally I did the most important thing first: caring for internet. The people at the shop were really nice and it was not an issue at all to get a Turkish SIM card as a German citizen. There was only one condition: I had to take a selfie with the shop staff at the end.

The medical emergency was a little bit more of a hassle. Finding the hospital was straightforward, but there nobody spoke English. I found myself standing at a counter with an administration lady asking me questions, which I could not answer. In addition I had one concern: As I have a private traveling insurance, I need to pay the doctor and medicine myself, and I had no idea what this cost -- with my credit card being at the limit; my last withdrawal had been the last for the coming few days. But as always, there are some magic words. After I had said the sentence "Do you speak English?" thrice, a djinn appeared. Well, actually it was not a djinn, but a nice man in the age of my father, who happened to be at the hospital due to his father, and who spoke perfect English. He went through the whole administration process with me, did the basic anamnesis for the doctor, organized someone to man the cash desk, such that I could pay -- everything. The doctor's diagnosis was short: "Infected!" -- and I got a prescription for an antibiotic ointment. When I returned from the treatment room, my interpreter had even got the change for me already and was apologizing how everything (registration, payment, treatment) had taken so long. In fact I had been in the hospital for half an hour. In Germany this time frame would have been a third of the waiting time until a doctor actually looks at you. And the costs were not worth mentioning -- far from going over my budget.

The next days, I was once again subject to Turkish hospitality; a street merchant waved me over to stop and gave me a big bag of cherries for free. When I was stopping for lunch at a nice picnic place, I was brought tea. The bakeries I came across were ever more often making the bread in wood ovens, and one could find them by following the wonderful smell of fresh-baked, warm bread. Once even the baker wanted to take a selfie with me.

Going over the steep mountains puts high strain on the bicycle. In the following days, there was a clicking noise extending through the right crank, which got louder and was soon accompanied by many more clicking noises. Fearing that the bottom bracket had some damage, and that damage was somehow propagated to the frame, I tried to exchange it -- however I was not able to move the washers holding it, even half a degree.

The next day I had an unpleasant encounter with a particular style of building roads. In this region, the whole street was first put as gravel, then tarred -- without locking it down for traffic. This led to me having to drive through fresh tar, with the gravel sticking to my bike, constantly fearing that it would cause some permanent damage.

When I passed through Bolu, I suddenly stood in front of a bicycle workshop, and had them replacing the bottom bracket for me. At this time, Maik and me were still quite close -- the shop owner asked me whether the guy with the earring and the broken tires was a friend of mine. In the store I got the answer why I had not been able to move the washers -- they have a left-hand thread. The new bottom bracket cost 50ŧ; so the same price as in Germany, only in a different currency. I was surprised with how new the "old" one still looked; and indeed, after going with it a little bit, I had to realize that the clicking noise was not caused by it, as it was still present with the replacement.

Before paying for the repair, I had to withdraw cash. The bicycle shop owner gave me his bike to go to he ATM, the description of where I would find one was straightforward: 300m, just round the corner. At the corner I could not find anything, and whoever I asked pointed me in the same direction. Another 300m further that way, I couldn't find anything either. In the end I started asking people whether they spoke English -- to my astonishment the first one I asked said yes. He was a young Iraki who had fled the war and was now studying physical education here in Bolu. He walked me through the whole city, where all ATMs seemed to have been built in one spot, instead of distributed across the city. While we walked, we talked about his situation a bit. I tried to find out whether he was only in Turkey due to the Turkish-European refugee treaty. He did not say whether he had had an original destination different than Turkey, but that to go further, he would need to "take an illegal road". He also told me about his uncle who had taken this road and was living and working in Germany right now, and who would come over in some weeks to visit him. Once he would be done studying, his chances of getting a job in Turkey would be close to zero, so his plan is to migrate to the US when he will be done -- I wish him all the best.

On the last day of Ramadan, the roads were more crowded than usual. People were doing picnics next to the road, and obviously driving through the country to visit relatives, as the roads were packed, sometimes even down to a chaos.

> ![End-of-Ramadan traffic jam](/images/IMG_3190.JPG)

As I wanted to avoid being an involuntary participant of some demonstration, I stayed on the man road longer than usual, to avoid Ankara. The traffic drove me mad however, so I left it soon after the junction leading to Ankara. Straight away, I was in a silent, beautiful valley with only occasional traffic passing by -- a relief after the traffic chaos on the D. 

> ![After exchanging traffic for nature](/images/IMG_3196.JPG)

I followed the road down into a bigger valley, in which I suspected to find a road leading me east again. I found a river, a village and a road that led up on the other side of the valley, i.e. leading further south. I also saw something else: a dirt road, not on the map, which seemed to follow the river in the direction I wanted to go. It looked like exactly what I had been looking for, so I went for it.

> ![The promising dirt road](/images/IMG_3199.JPG)

.The road continued over a willow, then another, and then became a narrow track. I decided to still try, when I met a farmer boy sitting there and looking after the grazing cows. He looked quite astonished to see a cyclist there, and I can't blame him I smiled at him, and he smiled back. I continued on the track, which soon became barely recognizable through the ever growing grass.

> ![The path, later on](/images/IMG_3200.JPG)

However, I had already gone some way, and I remembered that it was not too far to the next village, so I continued. The track was also still easy to follow. Though that was about to change soon. The slope of the mountain next to the river was drawing closer and closer, narrowing the shore strip and soon making the passage more difficult. The undergrowth was increasing. Riding the bike was no longer an option. I pushed the fully loaded thing through boggy stretches, then up the steep hill a bit, always following the path, which now seemed like it had been in disuse for the last years. When I was way above the riverbed, there was a quite dangerous situation where part of the slope had slided into the river. I passed only a little bit above the broken ground, happy that it had not started sliding again while I was on it. The path descended down to the river again. Every now and then, the undergrowth and forest was interrupted by lawns, on which it was easy to get through on the bicycle.

> ![Overgrowth -- this is still the path!](/images/IMG_3203.JPG)

I had thought it had been tough, but I had no idea. Soon afterwards, the undergrowth became hard to get through, the thorns of the plants scraping me and my luggage and making every step harder and harder. Checking the map I saw that I was nowhere close to having finished half of the stretch to the next village, where there would be a bridge and a connection to the main road. Yet I had the feeling that I had passed the point of no return, being the slided slope -- I didn't dare going over that again; I had challenged my luck already enough. The next obstacles in my way included boulders of the size of heads, where I had to half-carry the bike over and a particularly nasty stretch of driftwood combined with overgrowth, where I had to crouch next to the bicycle, while heaving it over the pile of wood. All the time I was wondering whether this was an appropriate time point to become afraid of myself -- after all I had gotten myself into this, had not heeded the signs and had been stubborn enough to continue although it had looked worse and worse; most likely just too proud to turn back and having to see the smirk on the farmer boy's face.
As if to add insult to injury, the grass was greener on the other side: Whenever I looked over, there were flat, easily passable meadows. I even considered crossing the river multiple times, but was too afraid to be washed away, all with bike and luggage.

> ![My beautiful campsite that day](/images/IMG_3213.JPG)

Yet, I still managed. It took me about two hours to go the six kilometers, it was bad for my bicycle and bad for my back, as I was semi-carrying it often, but at the end of the day I reached another smooth slope, where car tracks were starting again, and that would lead me to the village, and therefore back to the main road. I camped inside a wonderful, peaceful and unspoilt environment, yet unable to fully enjoy it, as I could still feel with every muscle how hard it had been just to get there.

Reaching the bridge the next day was a piece of cake, and I gladly headed back to the concrete.

After two months of preparation I finally hit the road today. I had the best departure weather I could wish for and therefore enjoyed my own cheerfulness quite a lot. I was very pleased to notice that good mood in combination with music makes highly frequented roads far more bearable than they are without the two. Although I guess that the compass dangling around my neck looked ridiculous to most people seeing me, it proved a good way of navigating without stopping too much, saving me multiple involuntary detours.

There's currently an interesting weather here, reminding me of the summer close to really high mountain ranges: While it's sunny and warm on the lower altitudes, there's snow on the mountains; a view I'm only used to in the Alps. Neat!

While I originally had planned to only stop by in Freiburg to do some errands, I arrived there surprisingly late and exhausted, and having done the only errand already on the way. I'm therefore staying at my sister's place.

The change of plans was rewarded with an original spanish-made paella, and a bed instead of a tent. I take this as an encouragement to change plans frequently along the way.

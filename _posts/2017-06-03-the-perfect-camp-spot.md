> ![Dragomir's bicycle](/images/img_2609.jpg)

One day when I was going upwards slowly, there were what felt like herds of cyclists. First there was a couple oncoming, similarly heavy loaded as me. Unfortunately (I can’t blame them, though) they did not interrupt their easy-going descend to tell  me where they went. Shortly afterwards I met Dragomir (I was told later that something that sounds like Dragomir means “pleased to meet you” in Serbian – cool name). Dragomir was taking it easy, pushing his bike up the slope. We had a short break together and talked a little bit with hands and feet as the only common language we had were his bits of English and my pieces of Czech-Croato-Serbian. He is 65 years old and lives in Belgrade. He rides an old Russian racing bike and is really minimalistic on luggage; carrying only two bags which are half the size of my small bags, plus a tent, and a bag on his handlebar. I am a little curious about the tent, because of my unsuccessful attempts to find a camping store, but our sign language is unfortunately not sufficient for that kind of inquiry. When I stopped at the next shop to do my groceries, he caught up with me. He invited me for a lemonade and did not accept any excuse. So we sat in the shadow of the sunshade outside the shop and talked about our trips. He is on a round trip from Belgrade to southern Serbia where he has relatives and back, a tour he does every now and then. In the past he did larger trips around Serbia as well.

Finding the appropriate tent spot is always a question of luck, and often it is a compromise, because there are many rules as to what is the perfect camp spot. First the ground: it should be nearly even, such that one does not slide inside the tent or roll over at night. Also, there shouldn’t be high bumps that cannot be compensated by the mattress. Another nice-to-have is privacy, as well as a river close by, for washing. There should always be a tree, to lean the bike against and to hang the water bag; in case of windy weather however, the tree should be far away enough as to not fall onto the tent if blown over. Short grass always helps during putting up the tent and there are less animals in lower grass; particularly snails (it’s quite tedious to hand-pick them from the outer and inner tent the next morning; nobody wants squashed snails anywhere on the tent). If it rains, camping inside a forest is a bad idea since even if the rain has stopped the next morning, the trees will still be dripping and one has to pack the tent wet. Even if it were not dripping from the trees, the shadow would prevent the tent from drying. One of the last and most important points on the wish list is not having midges.

So all of this makes the activity of camp-spotting quite a sport. Since I am in Serbia there is the unfortunate addendum that it did not really rain since I’m here and the days are hot, so I get woken by the sun earlier as desired because I’m getting cooked inside the tent.

To flee the getting-cooked-problem and sleep a little bit longer, I decided to try a forest – what a bliss! People could not see me from the road, there was shadow in the evening and in the morning, and adding to all of that I had dinner with a gorgeous view over the plains, at sunset time.

Plus no midges! So the next day I tried to go for a sequel – with fatal consequences. The camp spot was perfect; but for the detail with the midges. As I didn’t want to go to bed unshowered I decided that midges are just a part of outdoor life and bravely went ahead; later in the tent I felt like scratching my skin off at all parts of my body, having trouble to fall asleep. This was only surpassed by the view of my skin the next morning; although the stitches were no longer itching, it gave me physical pain just to see the vast number of red speckles everywhere. During breakfast I had to realize however that hunting season was not yet over: I got stung frequently even in the morning. So I made a correction to my mental camp spot checklist: The perfect camp spot is not in a forest but next to it, with the forest to the east and hopefully no bogs in the forest. Something like that.

In search of that, I went up a dead end the next day; but as I had had only little trouble finding a spot the days before, it seemed only fair that this time it would be difficult – and it was. It was getting later and later, with nothing adequate to be found. As it was an inhabited area, I started asking the locals whether they knew a lawn, or in rare cases, whether I could camp on theirs, but with no success. Until I met Igor and Vlado. The two were having a drink on Igor’s porch and spoke some English and some German, so we were able to communicate. They were very helpful and proposed to go looking with me, them going in front with Igor’s car. I only hesitantly accepted that; it was nice by them, but I didn’t want them to waste their time for me. In the end they insisted, so we started going. However we didn’t come far: after having gone for literally ten meters, they asked whether I wanted to have a drink with them instead. As I want to get in touch with the people during my trip, I gladly accepted, and we went back to the porch, drinking water and wine. The two were very interested in speaking different languages, my Slavic mixture and their German-English mixture leveling up, such that when we added hands and feet, we had loads of fun, and I think we all learned some of the other’s language. We went out to have “Serbian burgers”, as they called them, and Vlado’s brother Milan joined us. Serbian burgers consist of a starter and a main course. The ritual is as follows: Every participant gets an empty plate. Then many different dishes are put up in the middle of the table: different kinds of salads and pastes, some raw vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes. The waiter brings a flat loaf of bred, fresh and hot from the oven. Everybody at the table reaches out to grab the loaf, and then all pull at the same time – the lucky one ends up with the biggest piece, and all share the dishes on the center of the table and have them together with the bread. The main course is the same, just that everybody gets a big burger instead of an empty plate – delicious.

After the burgers we had some more wine on Igor’s porch, with Vlado’s girlfriend joining. I slept in a bed that night, and people might think that this is the perfect camp spot, but I am sorry to disillusion: a tent is far better ventilated than any room of a house in the heat of the summer. So the search for the perfect campsite will always go on. Thank you very much for your hospitality, Igor and Vlado, you made me feel welcome and at home!

The next morning we had tea together, with some other villagers dropping by. The mother of Vlado also paid a visit. Then Vlado and Milan went to work in the fields, the other villagers worked on a wall in front of Vlado’s house. It seemed like a highly inter-dependent community to me, where everybody contributes his or her skills to the common good. I saddled my bike again, heading towards Niš. Perhaps it was just due to the positive experience, but I had the feeling that the people in the close neighborhood knew who I am – everybody greeted friendly and once a guy on a tractor even stopped to tell me that I was going the wrong way, assuming correctly that I was headed towards Niš. I guess news spreads fast in the countryside.

* * *

As I’m going to get my Iran visa in Sofia, I have a fixed date when I can be there the earliest. As I was already too close, I had to kill some time in order to not arrive too early. Therefore I did not have greater plans than to cross Niš the next day. I started into my day by taking a break when I found benches and tables, protected from the sun by a roof. I did my laundry, worked on the blog, had breakfast. When I rolled into Niš I suddenly felt weak, so I had lunch on the spot, adding some dextrose to it. Sitting there on the side of a big road, I witnessed an interesting spectacle: A police officer on a motorbike rode quite fast, with siren, on the fast lane, gesticulating the evading drivers to keep right. He was followed by another one, then multiple black SUVs, surrounding a military vehicle heavily armored. The whole convoy never reduced its speed, but whizzed past me, obviously assuming that the officers going in front did a good job. It reminded me of how Saddam Hussein and his sons were said to commute when in power. I read a book saying that in fear of an attack, they were always going through the cities in many similar cars and at high speed. I was told later that the Serbian head of state travels like this as well – maybe it was him going through Niš that day. He can obviously afford going in a car with only small, tinted windows – after placarding the whole country with his face I guess nobody is in need of being reminded of his appearance.

In Niš I also had an unpleasant surprise: signs leading to a former Nazi concentration camp memorial. I had not known that the German folly had extended that far to the southeast to make people suffer even in Serbia.

The next day I planned to stay in the hostel in Pirot. The owner is my age, I had met him in Belgrade when asking my way to one of the infamous outdoor stores. He had told me that he had just given a speech to students on social entrepreneurship. He made the impression to me of someone full of ideas wanting to make a difference, so I was interested in having a longer talk with him, and had decided to stay in his hostel. After breakfast I made an unexpected acquaintance: a touring cyclist came up to me as I was checking my compass for the direction. After exchanging three words it became obvious that we are both German. His name is Maik, he has been traveling for years and just (it was his first day when we met) had changed his means of transport to a bicycle. As he is headed to Georgia and I enjoyed having company again, we joined routes for an indefinite period.

Maik knew a beautiful byroad, far from traffic and trucks, up through the mountains, so I gladly accompanied him. Remembering the badly adjusted gearing of my brother during our test trip, I half-joking asked him whether his gearshift was correctly adjusted, and got a yes. At the first hill this turned into a no, and I again got the feeling that I was doing this trip because I enjoyed nature, wanted to meet new cultures, but also, because I enjoy fixing bikes! So we got his gearshift right again, and up we went! I asked a lot of questions about his way of life, as I had heard about long-term travelers before, but had never mt one to get to know how they actually do it. Maik is traveling since four years now, occasionally working to get money again, and then traveling until he runs out of money, then working again – and all of this around the globe. Very impressive to me, as I have a fixed date when I will have a desk with a computer waiting for me.

We arrived to Pirot in the evening. As Alex, the hostel owner, had given me a leaflet with the name and logo of the hostel, I expected it to be a piece of cake to find it. When we rolled into the city, we asked locals for the hostel. They all knew about hotels, but nobody had ever heard of the hostel. We kept on asking different people with different degrees of helpfulness, until one of the taxi drivers even called the number on the leaflet and talked to whoever was on the other end of the line. We didn’t have a common language again, I understood that he told us to wait for ten minutes. When he then got in his taxi and started driving slowly, we realized we should follow him. Three corners later he stopped, in front of a plain looking building with a night club on the ground floor, as it seemed. We stood there waiting with the taxi driver, and tried to communicate with him, to get some more information from him. He finally managed to tell us that his son played or plays guitar in that house – and came to the conclusion that he had just gone there to pick up his son from his guitar lessons, so we decided to go to one of the hotels to ask for WiFi, in order to contact Alex. Maik at that time already doubted the existence of the hostel, but I was still quite convinced because Alex had seemed trustworthy to me. In the hotel where we asked for WiFi, the receptionist was really helpful: he looked for the address for us, let us use the WiFi, and even his phone, such that I could call Alex and ask what the heck was going on.

He explained that he was on the bus from Belgrade, as he had again been there on some errands, and that the landlord was on the way to the hostel, to open it up for us. He also described me the way to the hostel, and together with the maps on the receptionist’s computer, I came to the conclusion that the address looked terribly like the one where the taxi driver had led us before. Alex then gave us the notification that the landlord had arrived there by now, so we went there again, this time meeting someone. All in all, finding the hostel had been a very painful experience and the only reason I had had the patience to go through that was that I had met the owner before. So if anybody who reads this plans to open a hostel – please, please, have a reception that’s open when the hostel is, or at least make it clear to your guests that it is a PITA to find it.

After being surprised about how hard it can be to find a hostel, we were surprised a second time – we were not the only guests! Robert, a jolly American with German roots (along with the hostel owner) shared the hostel with us that night. He was doing tourism “away from the treaded path”, as he called it, and explored the beautiful surroundings of Pirot, and it was very entertaining listening to his stories. For example one day he had went to see the waterfalls close by. As there is only bad public transport in Pirot, the only way to get there had been a taxi, and paying the taxi driver for waiting for him, to take him back to the city. In the end, the taxi driver did not wait for him, but instead came along on the hike.

Remembering my last night in a house, being too warm, surrounded by stuffy air, I spontaneously took my mattress and sleeping bag out on the big balcony and had a wonderful night – maybe this was the perfect camp spot I had been looking for.

When I arrived, Christian had invited me straight away to stay at his place for two nights. I had immediately rejected, because I wanted to keep on cycling; after all I had only cycled for four days so far. It felt sort of stupid, starting my trip by taking a break ;-) However, as I was writing a blog entry the next morning, I was leaving late anyway. The weather was great, I had breakfast in the sun and was really looking forward to cycling in these enjoyable conditions.

This was when Christian told me that he would go up a 2502m mountain close by by cable car, and asked whether I wanted to join. It took me only little consideration to decide to join him and his dog Shyla; with this weather we would have a perfect view, and high, snow-covered summits are something I would not come across by bike.

We went up the Säntis that day, a mountain with magnificent surroundings. From the top we could see Lake Constance in its whole width, and Lake Zürich. Additionally, the surrounding peaks are of similar height and all worth seeing. Naturally, the way up in the cable car, very close to the snowy and steep slopes was breathtaking. And there was about 1m of snow on the top.

Christian went down with me into the tunnels that lead to the hiking tracks in the summer. They are accessible even in the winter, and one of them doesn’t have a door, so after Christian removed half a cubic meter of snow we could stand outside were there was nobody but us, again with a beautiful outlook. And knee-deep in snow!

Inspecting my braking pads later, I saw that the small bits of metal in them were actually parts of the rim. I removed them, and as Christian had all possible tools in his place, he gave me a piece of very fine sand paper with which I could even out my rims again, such that something like that would happen less frequently, which worked out well so far. Quite cliché, we had cheese fondue for dinner. Christian gave me a small glass of honey and a solar-and-crank-powered miniature flashlight as a parting present. Thank you so much for all your hospitality, Christian!

The next day I continued my journey east. The top view from Säntis had given me an idea of the surroundings and that going over to the Rhine valley would be the next step. As always I had no map, but a compass, and just followed the roads that were looking like they were leading in the direction I wanted to go. Christian had vacuum-packed me a big portion of the Chili, which I had for lunch.

The Swiss work hard to avoid unnecessary climbs -- I appreciate that a lot

When the road started to climb, I started asking locals how to get up the pass, as all the tourist informations were closed. In fact it seems that all Switzerland is closed by that time of the year, when the skiing tourists have gone – hotels, restaurants, holiday apartments; all locked doors and barred windows until the summer. The locals were really helpful, however; one even gave me a map and therefore compensated for the closed tourist informations very well. The small pass I took that day was called Resspass, 1300 and something meters. It was one of these small passes that I had intended to take most of the time, only leading to mountain farms, so no traffic.

The road was concrete all the way up, but only the way up. In the beginning the way down looked okay as well, with snow left and right and a free car track in between, but this ended at a nice lake. There, only small tracks remained, with either snow or many roots, not cyclable and most of them not going downhill. I had to go scouting on foot to check which one to take next. I decided for the one leading downhill the most, and ended up at a gate where I had to remove the luggage from the bicycle and carry it over. Afterwards I reached a tiny summit where I had dinner with a perfect view into the Rhine valley. Soon the roads were paved again and I very much enjoyed the way down.

Next I went mostly relaxingly flat in the Rhine valley, with only a small pass in between. A farmer allowed me to sleep in his barn, which was very welcome as most of my sleeping things were wet due to the rain the night before. I shared my sleeping surface with a bunch of newborn kitten. He even allowed me to use a sink in that barn – with warm (!) water.

The next day I had perfect sunshine and breathtaking views onto snow-covered, high mountains, as I slowly climbed into the skiing ranges of Saas and Klosters. From there the only way out was taking a narrow, winding road with lots of traffic up to Davos – I rode up there entirely on adrenaline due to the many cars passing with little space. But in the end I reached the Wolfgang pass unharmed and happy.

Up there I replenished my water supplies and was recommended to take the Flüela- instead of Julier pass. This suited me well as it meant going less south and more east. That high in the mountains I was afraid of a very cold night and therefore put on all the clothes I had with me, which worked out well. Due to the exhausting pass I went to sleep early and also started early the next morning to go up the Flüela pass.

It started with a little bit of rain, which then became a lot of snow further up. As I got closer to the pass, the wind started blowing in my face really hard. In the end there was all you need for a hard time: Snow, headwind, fog, cold and traffic. Funny enough, I was feeling nice and it felt good to bite myself through the oncoming storm and eating müesli bars like others eat potato chips. Some of the oncoming cars even gave me a thumbs up, cheering me on on the long way to the top. In the end I was positively surprised that the pass is way above 2000m high – the highest I’ve been so far by bike, and quite a contrast to the hot sun the day before, with temperatures close to zero.

To survive the way down, I put on all the clothes I had in the backpack; a little bit below the pass the snow walls on the side of the road were taller than me.
I reached the bottom of the Inn valley before noon. There I was given the choice of going straight for the “Ofenpass” or continuing along river Inn to the Reschenpass. Although I already cycled the Reschen before, I choose it to recover from the exhausting ride up the Flüela, going down along the Inn for another day. While cooking my lunch, a pedestrian asked me about my journey and told me that he cycled from Switzerland to Thailand some years before, saying that he thinks about it everyday. This encounter confirmed to me that I’m doing just the right thing. Shortly later, I camped in a forest nearby, after having felt the urgent need to recover.

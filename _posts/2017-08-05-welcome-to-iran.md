A traveling bike draws attention. I had queued as everybody at the Iranian border, but seeing the bike they asked me to come to the front of the queue. However, a traveling bike also seemed to require accuracy, and so I found myself to again be the reason for an ever-growing queue. The official even went to his superior to discuss something, clacking his heels on entering and leaving his office . After some questioning ("What's the purpose of your travel?" "What's your itinerary?" "Which embassy did you get the visa from?"), I was invited to cross over with a warm smile. From that moment on, I was treated very gently, the lady at the baggage control even gave me hints on what to visit in Jolfa. Just outside the border station, I got a welcome selfie with a jolly local. Slowly rolling through downtown Jolfa, many people addressed me in English, wishing me welcome. At the same time, I slowly began to realize how badly I was prepared for the crossing -- I had no knowledge at all of the language, and couldn't read the script. Even the numbers are written differently in Farsi. I had no internet connection to make up for the lack of knowledge, and I didn't have any money in the local currency, nor did I know the exchange rate.

To at least make up for the lack of money, I entered the first bank I encountered. The clerk did not speak English, but I could make myself understood by showing him a fifty dollar bill. The people next to me at the counter carried large bundles of Rial notes in plastic bags, and I pleadingly hoped that I would not get to carry such an unhandy amount of bills. The bundle of 50&nbsp;000 Rial notes that I got in exchange for the fifty Dollars was still impressive enough. Luckily it only just fit into the pouch I had bought from Necati, the Turkish carpet merchant. I got utterly confused when the clerk noted down the exchange rate. It looked like something close to 8000, while I had had roughly 40 000 in the back of my head. However I just accepted it, as this was my first "withdrawal". I would manage to get a better exchange rate next time.

Still with the 8000 Rial per dollar in the back of my head, I started doing my groceries. The seller asked 2500 Rial for it, which seemed reasonable. When I gave him a 5000 note, he however started to explain me that the last zero on the notes did not count, asking for a 50 000 note instead. My confusion was complete. As he could tell that I was reluctant to give him the 50&nbsp;000 bill, he offered to give me the cheese for free. I decided that it was high time to count my bundle of Rials. Computing the exchange rate myself, I actually came to a result close enough to the 40&nbsp;000, and the price the salesman was asking no longer seemed unreasonable.

How I learned later, there are unofficially two currencies in Iran. The official is the Rial. However, all prices are given in Toman, which is the name of the old currency which was abolished in 1925. The value of a Toman is informally agreed to be 10 Rial. To make things slightly more complicated: Iran's national bank plans replacing the Rial with a currency that's worth 10&nbsp;000 Rial. Guess what the name will be -- Toman.

I decided to get an Iranian SIM card next. I asked multiple people and got directions to a shop, however it was closed. I gave up for the moment and continued looking for my groceries. This endeavor was not easy either, as shops over here seemed to be more specialized on one particular thing, and I was not able to find something that resembled a supermarket enough to meet all of my needs.
This was when Mohammad asked me whether I needed some help -- he is a taxi driver, and speaks very decent English. He told me where I could get all my groceries, including fresh-baked Sangak bread, and walked me through the city in search of a shop selling SIM cards. We tried three until we found one that had what I needed.

On the way back, there were at least three more people greeting me and welcoming me to their country. The most impressive was: "Welcome, thank you for visiting my country. If you need anything, I am here for you." Imagine someone doing that in a western country.

While crossing the border, my rearview mirror had broken off. Leaving Jolfa, some meters were enough to convince me that it was essential to have one. The traffic and also the general acoustics (honking) were quite similar to Turkey. I fixed the mirror with the two most essential spare parts I had with me: Duct tape and cable ties.

> ![There's nothing that can't be fixed with Duct tape and cable ties](/images/IMG_4197.JPG)

Leaving Julfa, the road soon narrowed down to one lane in each direction, going uphill through a dry, dusty landscape. The car drivers seemed to pay attention to me, I never had to evade anybody. However, people were quite relaxed while overtaking; a car overtaking another would sometimes take ages to pass by, and with oncoming traffic, three cars abreast plus a bicycle, it sometimes became quite narrow between the guardrails.

> ![On the way to Marand](/images/IMG_4202.JPG)

A little bit before Marand, my good impression of the traffic was destroyed. On an entirely empty road, a car packed with youngsters overtook with no safety distance at all, honking in the very moment they were next to me, obviously with the goal of frightening me. They managed, and luckily failed to kill me incidentally.

My host Saeed picked me up in Marand and led me to a house he owns. As he was already having his parents in law around, I stayed in the house instead of his flat. He apologized all the time that he was sort of "parking" me there on my own, while I was unable to make him understand how much I had craved for just this -- being on my own and in a protected environment. I asked to stay a second night, to relax a bit, and Saeed luckily agreed.

Later, we had dinner together with the whole family. I had to discover that I was not yet familiar to the customs. Arriving, I shook hands with his father in law. When I wanted to proceed shaking hands with his wife, she politely, but determinedly receded. We had a delicious dinner in the -- like they called it -- *Iranian* way, meaning sitting on a carpet instead at a table. It was delicious and a unique cultural experience for me.

The second day in Marand, I planned my route for the following days. After Tabriz, I would have had the option to either go north to the Caspian Sea, or continue straight to Tehran. Both cases meant finishing too early, and I decided to take a longer break in Tabriz to make up my mind on whether to re-book the flight to an earlier date, or how to idle away the remaining time.

> ![Beautiful landscape on the way to Tabriz](/images/IMG_4210.JPG)

Going to Tabriz, the colorful mountains again caught my eye. They look like they are just sand mountains, but I guess it's actually sandstone. The looks are stunning, because they exist in so many different colors, with red being predominant.
Twice there were tiny tornadoes, whirling around cardboard boxes and dust. To prevent falling I had to stop, clutch the bicycle and close my eyes until they had passed.

Although it is a quite big city, the traffic in Tabriz was pleasant to drive through. The highway had four lanes, of which the leftmost two always went over the junctions, while the rightmost were for the cars taking the junction. The trick to get through there unharmed and fast was to always drive in the middle of the road, on the line between the overpassing and the branching lanes. While it felt odd to go in the middle of a four-lane road, with cars passing by to the left *and* to the right, this was the only way to avoid both the risky lane changes and junctions.

My host Mehdi, who is slightly younger than me, welcomed me very warmly to the home of his family. The house is in a residential area with alleys so narrow that cars cannot easily pass them. As a result, there is no traffic and the area is very quiet. In their yard, they keep hens and have a grapevine which forms a roof of leaves over it.
Mehdi's room, and especially his wall, reminded me a lot of myself. Just like me, he had self-made motivational posters to keep him studying and at the same time remind him that there's a life beyond university.

For dinner, Mehdi took me to the most fancy place of the city -- a mall. I was taken aback by how money just equalizes everything and even seemed to erase cultural differences between Iran and Europe. It felt and looked just like any mall anywhere in Europe. We met up with two fun friends of Mehdi, Pouya and Mobin.

As the guest I got a room on the top floor, which did not have any furniture, but carpets. For sleeping we used mattresses which were only taken out for the night and stored away in a cupboard during the day. The house is built in a way such that it is ventilated naturally, with a pleasant, cool breeze blowing through the rooms all through the night. On the whole trip, I had never slept as well as in that night.

The next morning, Ivanka from Croatia and Mateusz from Poland joined us. We had a delicious breakfast, which Mehdi prepared for us. Ivanka and Matt introduced me to what we called *sweet cucumber*, because it tasted and looked just like that. According to Mehdi it is a kind of melon in an early maturity state. We went to the Bazar, where Mobin and Pouya joined us again.

> ![One of the entrances to the Bazar](/images/IMG_4234.JPG)

The Bazar is huge, far larger than the one I had visited in Istanbul. In a maze of narrow indoor alleys, masses of locals and few tourists squeeze through. Numerous patios with trees and water basins allow to escape from the turmoil and relax in the shade. Most of the shops are being delivered using big, custom-welded pushcarts from square metal profiles. Their drivers urge the crowd out of their way by shouting "Yalla" in a regular rhythm, which means "come on" or "let's go". According to Mehdi it literally translates to "may god help you". Occasionally, there were even motorcycles driving through the crowds.

When I got hungry, I got a big, heavy pack of dates (probably 2kg). Before buying I had expected to finish it quickly, with the help of the others. As always, my appetite had been greater than my hunger; in the end, the dates were our constant company during the whole next day as well.

For lunch, we had a unique and very delicious cultural experience. It was a dish consisting of sheep meat, cooked with tomatoes and chickpeas in a strong broth. It was served in a cup, with bread, a pestle and a bowl. As the starter, we tore the bread to small pieces, poured the broth over it and ate it as a soup. Then we mashed the meat and vegetables with the pestle and ate the delicious mush as the main course.

In the afternoon, we visited the municipality palace, which these days serves as the municipality museum. As weaving carpets is a traditional and important industry in Tabriz, the museum houses a carpet hall, displaying some impressive pieces of this handicraft. While some of the carpets strike with almost photo-realistic portraits, others imposed with sheer size. The largest one is the *mother carpet*, measuring 112m².

> ![The mother carpet in the municipality museum](/images/IMG_4275.JPG) 

We visited the *Arg of Tabriz* [[4]](#arg-of-tabriz), a huge remnant of a massive fortress in the middle of the city. The fortress was built in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The remaining wall is among the highest historical walls in Iran and so massive that I was immediately reminded of The Wall from *A Song of Ice and Fire* -- only made of stone instead of ice. For some time, I just sat in the pleasant shade of the impressive building and enjoyed the sheer, awe-inspiring size of it.

The last stopover in the city was Kabud Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque. In contrary to the blue mosque in Istanbul, it lives upon it's name. The mosque was completed in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, and lay in ruins since an earthquake in 1780. The reconstruction started in the seventies and has not finished until today. The minarets are still missing and the outer walls remain modest, displaying the bricks. These imperfections however made it one of my favorite buildings on the journey; it gave the building a welcoming, down-to-earth atmosphere.

In the evening we hiked up Mount Eynali, which is a popular leisure destination for Tabriz' inhabitants. The sun had already set when we started our ascend. In contrary to the daytime, the air was clear and we had a gorgeous view over the sea of lights produced by the 1.7 million metropolis.

> ![Ma'joon](/images/IMG_4277.JPG)

On the way back home, close to midnight, we took one last detour to taste different local ice cream specialities. I decided for a *Ma'joon*, an ice cream with whipped cream, pineapple and ground pistachio. Mateusz tried a *Faloode*, an ice cream in the form of noodles.

For the next day, I had planned to stay at home during the day, to make up my mind about my future route. Being honest to myself, I realized however that there was no need to muse too much about that decision. In spite of the warm welcome I was getting each day, I noticed that I felt that it was time to go home again. While the others were discussing what to visit that day, I booked the flight and wrote messages to the Warmshowers host in Hashtrud, which is one day from Tabriz.

When I was done, the others had just sorted out that the plan was to visit lake Urmia with Pouya and Mobin, as Mehdi had to stay at home for studying. Lake Urmia is next to the Turkish-Iranian border. It used to be the largest lake in the middle east. Due to climate change, damming of the supplying rivers and pumping of ground water, it has dried out. It is now 10% of its original size, leaving behind loads of salt and adversely affecting the climate of the region.

We went there in Mobin's Peugeot Pars. The Pars is a facelift of the Peugeot 405 model, and was produced by the Iranian car manufacturer Iran Khodro. The company has and still does manufacture cars and trucks from different brands under license, among them Peugeot, Renault and Mercedes. Their most successful model was the *Paykan*, a Chrysler license build that was produced from 1967 until 2005. Together with the pickup version *Bardo*, which seems to be available only in white and blue, it characterizes the streetscape of Iran.

The ride to the lake took about one and a half hours and was spectacular. We rolled down the windows, turned up the music and sang together. Arriving at the dried out portion of the lake, it required knowing that there was indeed a lake -- the desert at the side of the road did not look too different from the no-lake desert. There is a causeway crossing the lake. It is said to have worsened the already fatal situation of the lake. Arriving there, we took a turn away from the "shore", crossing in the direction of Urmia city. As we approached the water remaining in the basin, the ground next to the road began to whiten, and soon puddles of water became distinguishable in the white desert. Further on, the puddles had grown significantly -- now the reddish remainders of the lake were extending up to the horizon. Only that the horizon had disappeared. According to Mateusz, the high salt concentration in the water is accompanied by a change in the reflection properties of the water, making the line between the water and the sky blur out beyond recognition.

We stopped next to a stranded ferry, stuck in the salt. It was Friday, the only day of weekend in Iran, so there were families all around, bathing in the warm, salty brine. The ferry had the looks of being ready to depart at any time; it required boarding the ship to see that there were was no more cockpit on board. However, a man standing at the rail looked to me like a captain, waiting for the passengers to board.

> ![Observe the horizon in this picture](/images/IMG_4293.JPG)

The salt had all degrees of hardness. Well away from the water, it was rock-solid, not even crunching below the feet. Close to the water, it could not withstand my body weight, and walking opened ankle-deep puddles of warm water. Where the water had dried out recently, the salt had crystalized into small discs.

> ![Heart-shaped salt](/images/IMG_4310.JPG)

There were no elevated structures around the lake that could have served to give shadow. The heat was excruciating and the sun was burning relentlessly. My circulation was down to a low, and I felt utterly exhausted. I was relieved when we finally turned towards the car again. On the way back, we saw a camel herd grazing next to the road and their shepherd.

> ![Landscape like a painting](/images/IMG_4320.JPG)

Back in Tabriz, we had dinner in a restaurant which did not have tables and chairs. Well, there was a kind of a mixture of both: There were low tables, big enough to hold a large carpet. At three of the edges, there were backrests like on a bench -- it was the furniture needed to eat the Iranian way in a restaurant. During dinner we were talking about how it is to have relationships in Iran, and learned that holding hands without being married can earn you two days in prison.
We whiled away the evening with a walk around the lake in El Gölü Park; I then separated from the group to prepare myself for going cycling again the next day.

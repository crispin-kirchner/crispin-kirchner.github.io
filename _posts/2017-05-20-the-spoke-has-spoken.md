On my 15th day on the road, I observe a cyclist with little luggage who obviously tries to find a cycle route. He is Norwegian, from somewhere close to Trondheim. His occupation is to care for the drilling fluid on drilling platforms in the north sea, by education he is a civil engineer. Work on drilling platforms is intense: In two weeks time, he works so many hours that he gets the following four weeks off. With this rhythm, he has the same working hours in a year as someone with a regular 9-to-5 job. As the process of drilling for oil is completely unknown and mysterious to me, I ask a lot of questions. We split up as I begin looking for a spot to make my lunch, as he is a little bit in a hurry – he goes from Munich to Venice with luggage transport service and had an unexpectedly long tour that day as he had to circumvent a construction site.

As the opening hours in this part are quite Spanish (long lunch breaks), I am short on vegetables for lunch. Out of sheer coincidence, I notice that I’m cooking right next to a forest overgrown with wild garlic ; I therefore add this to my Risotto. Continuing, I realize that I have been cycling on a high plain; suddenly I’m in a valley again, descending steeply to the south.

Nature is again overwhelming: steep slopes densely grown over with forests everywhere. As the valley opens, the motorway to Venice comes into sight: a monstruous construction on spires, spanning the whole valley. There is even a merging of two highways on these pillars, suspended above the jungle. Not only the motorway reminds that Venice is close, also the architecture: many churches in the villages have towers resembling the St. Mark’s Campanile.

It’s vital to stick to the main roads in the villages here. What has no direction sign turns out to be a dead end in 90% of the cases. Luckily there are still many tiny roads from village to village and I don’t have to resort to roads with traffic. Bread becomes a little bit a problem: The common bread here is light as a feather and white as snow and it is not uncommon for me to eat two loaves per meal. Many houses here have bread boxes at their fences – a little box similar to a mailbox – just for bread instead.

The following day, I come across Manuel, while he is running. He speaks no English, but Spanish and is excited about my completely planless way of traveling. In a public bookshelf, I pack the only non-Italian book, as I’m about to finish the book I have with me. For lunch I find a sparse forest, with much space between the trees, and no undergrowth. The sunlight filters through the thin layer of leaves and produces a refreshing green light. Wild berries grow on the ground. I am completely alone here, although it is weekend and a wonderful place to stay.

Next to the forest there is a canal; down by the water there is an almost ghostly silence. Cycling in the plain is, in contrary to the mountains, no longer limited by my physical condition, but by my butt; Even though my legs want to go on, I need to take breaks to rest my sitbones. The pain most likely also exists in the mountains, but there the physical strain is more intense and overpowers my butt’s moaning. This night are fireflies flying around the bushes opposite to my tent.

On mother’s day I come across a completely straight road leading to Udine. There is a lot of traffic, but I still decide to take it. First, because there is a rather wide hard shoulder, allowing me to drive safe, and because it goes exactly in the direction I’m interested in. I remember that Manuel had recommended me this exact road, and I had neglected his advice saying I was not in a hurry. But now that I see it it’s all too tempting to go straight for some time and not to have to check the direction at each cross or T-junction. To honor Sunday, I get asparagus for lunch and have a risotto on a playground in a village, arriving in Udine shortly later.

When cycling out of Udine I come across an ice cream shop that has quite some visitors and I decide that the time for granting myself an ice cream has come – especially because I’m about to leave the country famous for it. That evening I come across a wonderful campsite: amidst of fields, there is a small island with some trees and a lawn; I’m surrounded by open space as far as the eye can see, and still I have all the privacy I can wish for. As I am not washing in a river that day, but showering with my water bag, I use my shampoo for the first time in 13 days. It feels glorious. The hair that used to cling together in thick dags is suddenly fine again.

When packing together in the morning, I notice that the luggage carrier is now also broken on the other side. As the repair had worked out well, I had not replaced it, but continued using it for 5 more days. I repeat the repair of last time, but also see that I won’t make it far that way. Spokes bend too easily, and now that the whole carrier is kept together only by spokes, it is no longer stiff enough for all the luggage. I decide that it will be replaced in Ljubljana and hope that the fix will hold until there. Sure it doesn’t, and a little bit later I adjust the tilting of the carrier such that the luggage compresses it instead of bending. I am closer to the Slovenian border than I knew and I’m suddenly in a different country. The border is barely noticeable: later that day I come across a sign again stating the end of Italy – I hadn’t even noticed leaving Slovenia again. Slovenian seems similar to Czech for me, and although I only know some words of Czech, I instantly feel kind of at home. A street sign from Prague at a bar increases this feeling even more. I notice with glee that people speak English here way more often than it has been the case in Italy. Straight after the border, Cherries are being sold – I have never seen ripe cherries that early in the year. The spot where I cook my lunch that day also as a cherry tree next to it and I eat some while waiting for the rice to soak. There are also rusty pieces of reinforcement steel. I check whether it’s possible to break off parts of it, which luckily works; my luggage carrier is therefore strengthened by this way more robust material. Concluding, it is kept together by cable ties and rusty bits of metal, but this combination makes it feel really sturdy and trustworthy again.

Right with the Slovenian border, the hills started again. On a hilltop I come across a view tower and for the first time on my trip I can see the sea in the south. Turning around, there are snow-capped summits in the north. I suddenly have an attack of cereal bar-appetite and eat 7 of them; afterwards I’m cycling a lot uphill with a lot of energy. On a field, there are young cows and a bull joyfully jumping around and playing – a rare and wonderful sight.

In Ljubljana I am going to stay at Dušan's place, a friend who I met during my last semester in Sweden. In the morning, the rest of milk I had had with me had turned into cheese, so I’m eating my breakfast dry. To circumvent the flat and highly trafficked road to Ljubljana, I turn towards the mountains again.

I’m going up a long way in the sun, through pine forests and with a view down to where I started. I reach the highest point at lunch time and realize that this possibly means that I will not reach Ljubljana that day. However, the way down is less steep than up, which is a good thing, because this means I’m making good distance, profiting from the steep climb earlier. In the evening, when I start thinking about looking for a camp spot, I decide to check the distance to Ljubljana – and it’s less than 20km! Immediately I check with Dušan whether it is OK if I arrive a day earlier than I assumed . As I get the OK, I’m cycling like crazy, overtaking people who have far less luggage. Euphoria goes a long way! As I reach the city, I’m cheering loudly. After my first warm shower in 13 days, I’m lying in bed and realize how much the tent has become my home – the silence in the room feels unnatural compared to the sounds of nature that normally surround me. Also, the ceiling is strangely far away from me. One just gets used to anything.

The next day Dušan and me go on a shopping trip. I need to exchange the broken parts of my bike and also get some new ones, like e.g. a rearview mirror. As the first shop didn’t have everything I wanted, we search for bicycle stores nearby. The one which is next is a little bit hidden, but we find it after some looking around. It turns out to be a workshop only, with no parts for sale at all, but the owner Drago gives us the address of where he buys his spares. We get into a conversation. He tells us that he is member of the last vintage of a special bicycle mechanic school which he graduated from in 1971. After my last encounters with bicycle shops I’ve become cautious, but I realize that he is most likely one of the few people who I would trust to fix my rear wheel: The tire had grown a bump shortly after putting it on and that bump in combination with the luggage has bent the wheel a bit. I plan to put on a bump-less tire, but feared that the new tire would then get bumpy again due to the bent wheel. The mechanic takes the bike inside immediately, and after five minutes my rim is straight again. He doesn’t want any money and wishes me a nice trip.

In the next store I’m replenishing my supply of spare spokes, as the carrier repair ate up four of them. There are three different lengths on a bike, one at the front and two at the rear wheel. As I say I don’t know the exact lengths, the clerk doesn’t return with a measuring tape, but instead with a single spoke and tells me to try it. He goes back and forth between his stock and me, always carrying a single spoke for testing. As I’m not in a hurry I’m okay with this strange way of measuring spoke length, although it’s very time-consuming. In addition to the rearview mirror I bought, I also crafted a flag that sticks out of my luggage to the left, such that car drivers won’t dare to overtake with too few distance.

Dušan tells me that German labeling of a product is seen as a grant of quality in Slovenia. In that context it seems strange that in Germany many things get English names, as English in Germany is seen as a grant for fancyness. Family Kalanj is very kind to me, they let me stay at their home for two nights, invite me to their table like another member of the family, give me tools for the repairs and much more. It was a pleasure staying with you!

On my last day in Ljubljana, Dušan shows me around the city a bit by daylight. We go up the castle and enjoy the view all around the city. After lunch I’m packing my things and leave for putting a little bit of distance under my tires. I escape Ljubljana’s rush hour by swerving onto forest tracks. Because of the good weather forecast, many farmers have mowed their fields and I am camping on a huge piece of land where the hay has already been collected. The river Sava is close by. Up here it is flowing with intimidating speed, but I, also because of the water temperature, only wash myself at its bank instead of going for a swim.

> ![River Sava in Slovenia](/images/img_2351.jpg)
River Sava in Slovenia

The coming days, Sava is my companion, except for when I take a detour. It flows wildly here, with maddening speed and many rocks in between. Most of the time there is a tiny street going from village to village on one bank of the river, and I try to follow these. I have lunch in the shadows of the trees at the river bank. The bank is quite steep, and in a vain attempt to save me some of the hassle of carrying down my bags individually, I drop the bag with my passport, money and phone down the slope. Looking after it, I realize that the vegetation is not as dense as it seemed, because the damn thing keeps on rolling in the direction of the river, ever faster. With adrenaline rushing, I climb and run behind it, pushing plants to the side, ready to jump into the river and swim after my bag. Luckily it stops rolling just at the waterline. I decide to use a less valuable bag for such experiments in the future.

A little bit later, the road I’m taking turns into sort of a dead end – the only way is up. A resident tells me that the climb is 6km, so I get water at the next house. Stromae’s beats get me up that hill. From time to time it’s so steep that I’m taking a long break about each 20m. Up here there are many farms. It seems typical for the region to have long rods for barn walls, or sometimes even long rods with a roof, without a barn attached. The rods are used for hanging things to dry. I see hay and corn drying on this kind of structure.

The good thing about listening to music while riding is that it gives you a mental push, while cars are still easily heard when the music is put at a reasonable volume. The only problem is that the bicycle is also constantly talking to you; most damages you hear before noticing them. But you don’t hear them when you listen to music. As I’m going down the mountain again on the other side, I notice that the rear brake handle is wiggling when I release it – a strange sensation I haven’t experienced before. On a straight stretch I look down at the brake itself and I am presented with a scary sight: Both brake arms are rhythmically oscillating. I stop as soon as possible and see my worry confirmed: a spoke broke and now the whole wheel is out of balance. I push the bike until the next spot suitable for a repair and take out the wheel. A little bit annoyed I remember that I need to take off the gears in order to get the new spoke in. But after checking the tool- and the material bag twice, I have to admit to myself that I obviously forgot to pack the cassette remover – what a bummer! I still manage to get in the new spoke, although slightly bent. I tell myself that this shouldn’t be an issue, as the spoke is drawn straight anyways when tensioning. I then repeat what I had seen Drago doing two days before: spin the wheel, and whenever I see that it is not straight, tensioning the related spoke. Quite proud, I have a round running wheel again a little later. Only afterwards I realize that I had loads of luck that a left-hand-side spoke broke. On the other side it would have been plain impossible to get in the new spoke without removing the gears. I therefore decide to buy the missing tool as soon as possible.

To compensate for the time used in the spoke exchange, I cycle a bit longer that day. In the evening I come across a huge chimney, taller than the mountains surrounding it.

After the night, the task is shopping again: New nose spray against my allergy, as I used up the old, and the cassette remover. After approximately 10km, I come across the first bicycle store. It has many bike parts, so I’m quite confident that they will have what I need. The boss tells me in good English that they do, however in a different branch, another 20km away. He recommends me a very nice route how to get there. I am very happy by now that the spoke was already fixed yesterday – from 40km cycling with a broken spoke and the load in the back, the rim would most likely have suffered a permanent damage. As I arrive at the correct branch, a car also does – the boss of the bicycle store. He offers me tea, and takes the time to explain me in detail how this model works, as it’s completely different from the ones I know, but in a smart way. The owner tells me that it’s a Slovenian invention and that he knows the inventor. For an ordinary cassette remover you need two more heavy tools, which I’m carrying. This model uses the drivetrain of the bike to produce the necessary torque – very, very smart. Had I had such a cassette remover from the start, my luggage would be 400g lighter.

The shop owner also tells me that Croatia is a part of the European Union, but not a part of the Schengen agreement. I have to admit that these many different european clubs, like the Euro currency, Schengen, the EU itself get me confused from time to time. As I am rolling out of Slovenia, the border officer is not walking more eagerly towards me than the officers in Switzerland, and I’m not sure whether he just wants to say Hi or wants my paperwork. When I’m already partly over the border, he tells me to stop and asks for my papers, kindly reminding me that “this is a border”. To apologize, I tell him that I’m not familiar with the protocol, as I haven’t crossed a proper border yet on my tour. He checks my documents, wishes me a nice trip; a similar procedure coming into Croatia again. Rolling further I realize that this is not only the first proper border of my trip, but rather of my life. At least I can’t remember having gone through such a control-on-out – control-on-in procedure before, in my whole life.

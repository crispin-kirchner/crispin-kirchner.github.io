Leaving Pirot the next day, I ate my first Burek (it had to be in Serbia I had been told before, so it was high time). Afterwards, there was again a highway under construction that we could use. It was very hot and the air was flickering over the black concrete.

We decided to take some selfies in this scenery. In the last village before the Bulgarian border, we stopped to to spend our last Serbian Dinars – and terrified I had to realize that my wallet was not where it should be. I had no idea where I lost it, but Maik told me that he had seen it lying on one of my front bags during the photoshooting (he’s right – one can see it on the photos). In the hope of finding it on the first meters, I started going back. Maik did me the favor of staying with the luggage, such that I could go faster to look for the wallet. I’m had tailwind on the way back, therefore I went very fast, always telling me that I would turn back at the next bridge, only for then keeping on riding. In the end I returned to the spot where we took the photos and could see the roofs of Pirot again. A few meters after the photos, the wallet had fallen – it was still lying in the middle of the highway. Happy to have it back, I started back again, but this time with strong headwind, and I had to fight hard to be back where Maik is waiting in reasonable time. In the end, the wallet accident got me plus 30km on that day. As always close to a border, all traffic is routed onto one road in the end. In our case it was narrow, with only one lane per driving direction and we shared it with trucks. This led to a hairy situation: one of the trucks overtook us in a curve, and was therefore seeing the oncoming truck too late. When the driver evaded it, Maik and me have to evade too – into the ditch. We were very happy that there was one, if not it would have been the wall of rock next to it for us. This was the most dangerous situation on the whole trip so far for me, on my 38th day. For Maik it was only the 2nd. On the border, as always (though I don’t quite understand why) the most questions were asked from the leaving side. Shouldn’t it be the other way round? As the country we leave is getting rid of us, why do they care where we go next and what our destination is?

We witnessed the funny scene of four people pushing a broken car over the border. Right after the border I made the first acquaintance with aggressive wild dogs: the ones I had met so far had always been afraid of humans. The pack we came across here was quite different: they charged at us and followed us for some time, barking. One even bit one of my rear bags, I could feel my bike slowing down for a short time. Maik counter-attacked by yelling at them loudly, while I tried my pepper spray – without any consequence, I could have guessed that aiming the thing correctly is not easy – moreover, aiming/throwing things has never been one of my strengths ;-) In the end the dogs always lose interest after some time, as we are faster on the bikes. The far nicer acquaintance after the border were many Turkish truckers waiting in line at the border – it’s the first time that I get to greet someone with “Merhaba” on my trip; I know from the Turkish greeting from the children’s song "Paule Puhmanns Paddelboot".

In the evening, the sky got cloudy, and we had to expect rain. As Maik has a tent which needs to be put up in the dry, he chose a tunnel under a railroad as a camp spot. I picked a patch of green next to the road a little further. The spots were good: The road was of cobblestones and therefore there was no traffic at all. We had a small river for washing, I even saw a humer-like animal sitting in it. And Maik had a dry night (which would have been impossible with any other camp spot): After unpacking the tent for the first time in the tunnel, he realized that it didn’t have an outer hull and therefore is not rainproof.

The next day we fled the traffic on the main road by again taking a byroad. The surface was of mediocre quality, but in exchange there was no traffic and flocks of butterflies surrounding us. Maik took some beautiful butterfly pictures with my camera.

In the first Bulgarian shop we visit, I was delighted to see that the plastic bag-madness seemed to be a purely Serbian phenomenon. If one was not paying attention prior to the border, shop clerks sometimes packed each item you bought (even if it was already in a plastic packaging) into a separate plastic bag, and then put the whole plastic bag collection into another plastic bag. 

I also bought the deep-fried sweets made of a dough an dripping with oil and sugar-water – delicious! After we didn’t get a single reply from WarmShowers in Sofia, Maik booked us into a hostel he already knew. Google Maps led us the last part through Sofia – over four tracks of railroad which don’t seem to be intended to be crossed. We only got over there by carrying the bikes over one by one, me taking the handlebar and Maik taking the rear part. It was very exhausting, and I was already exhausted anyway and I could barely lift the heavy bikes over the rails.

Shortly after us, another cycling couple from Germany arrived at the hostel: he had been working in China for some time and was now going back to Germany by bike. He had been on the road for one year now. She was joining him in her holidays for the last five weeks of his journey. It was very interesting to discuss about why we had our bikes the way they were and to hear about the breakdowns he had had on his trip so far – he also had issues with his tent rods and told me that Decathlon had spares.

The visa to Iran is a complicated process: First, one needs a letter of invitation from an Iranian travel agency. This is sent to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and checked. Ten working days later (a.k.a. two weeks), a reference number is sent to the embassy of choice (in my case Sofia). With the reference number, one can apply for the visa.

I had applied for the reference number on my first day in Croatia. According to my calculations, the reference number should have been ready on my arrival in Sofia. When I checked with my agency however, I was told that I had overlooked two religious holidays in Iran – including the current day.

I therefore spent the rest of the day making use of the WiFi in the hostel, by programming a little bit; now I have an automated workflow that processes the GPS logs from my phone, and then does the deployment to my blog as well – now the path I have taken is visible on the blog. In the morning of the next day, I got the OK and the reference number from the travel agency – thank god. I would have hated to just sit and wait for two days because I had not checked the Iranian holidays. I called the embassy (no roaming – calling a Bulgarian number costs the same as calling a German! Neat!) to make sure that they also got the number. The lady told me that she would call me back. My experience with German authorities is that this means she won’t do nothing and I would have to call her again, so this is what I did one hour later. She again told me that she was not able yet to check with the consul and insists that I should not call again and that she will really call back. Maik advised me to not try it again after at least two hours, and we went to Decathlon to do some spare part shopping. They had tent rods in the exact size I need and threaded gas canisters – I am delighted. Mike got a waterproof tent. As I left the shop, I actually got called back by the lady at the embassy: everything is ready and I can come to apply for the visa. I instantly got a bad conscience because I had thought so badly of her. I immediately went back to the hostel to fetch my passport photos and headed to the embassy, which is on the other side of the city. In total two hours passed between the call and my arrival at the embassy. At the front door I found what I was not able to find on the website: opening hours. A guard tells me friendly, but determined: “not today.” I resigned and resorted to some random sightseeing on the way back to the hostel, where I shared my new tent spare parts (the rods go in packages of 16) with the other bike tourer, who had not bought them but had resorted to some adventurous fixes.

The next day I got up early to be the first in the queue which I expected to meet at the embassy. In fact I was the first – even before the people working there. No queue to be seen. I arrived at the embassy together with the lady who answered the phone (“Are you Mr. Kirchner?”) and had to wait a little until the consulate section opened its doors. While I had thought I’d fill in the application form and hand over the passport photos, the man in charge had a different picture in mind: I had to additionally bring my CV, a passport copy and to print the application form myself. Knowing that going to the hostel and back without printing anything would cost me two hours, I call Maik; two hours later the consulate section would soon close again. Luckily Maik could access my computer in the hostel and uploaded the necessary documents, while I looked in OpenStreetMap for a copy shop nearby. Arriving there, it turned out to be a 3D-printing service. The people there were still very friendly and helpful when I told them about my situation: I could use their computer and do the printouts for free! So in the end I had all the paperwork done an hour later and handed in the application. When it comes to payment, I got the information that I would have to wait for the visa for seven days. Seven days! Sending it to the embassy in Istanbul is not possible. Luckily there is an express option for more money: get the visa the next day for 1.5 times the price – I went for that option without hesitating. The hostel alone for three days would have cost more than the additional visa cost, plus I didn’t like the idea of waiting for seven days in Sofia; I was already now fed up with the exhaust gas-laden air I breathed commuting in the city by bike. So in the end I got all the paperwork done in the office hours of the consulate, and with an appointment to collect my visa thee next day at 11am.

The next day, I’m went to collect the visa with the fully loaded bike, in the hope that there would be no problems. A little bit later I am the proud holder of a thirty day visa to Iran!

Waiting for Maik, I did my laundry on the toilet of a nearby hotel, and we left the city uphill. When doing our groceries, I met two of the embassy guards again in the parking lot. It’s a long climb upwards, in between we’re as high as 1200m above sea level. We are rewarded with nice nature and nice views over Sofia on the way up. We spend the night on 900m, and I’m finally in a tent again.

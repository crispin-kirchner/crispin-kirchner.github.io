Seeing the no-traffic face of the Black Forest

After having spent quite some time in my youth commuting the Black Forest by bus, it was quite a surprise to me how idyllic and far off regular traffic one can cross this mountain range; there are awesome cycle routes there, mostly concrete and still next to no traffic. I turned off the music to listen to birds and streams instead. I interrupted the first ascend on my trip with many photo breaks; not only for the landscape, but rather because it was quite exhausting with all the luggage and in the end difficult to get by because it was all snow and only a narrow clear strip to ride in – my personal training session for the Alps to come!

After the pass, close to Feldberg

I spent the following night on the lawn of a very nice farmer family who also rent out holiday apartments; So if you plan a holiday in the black forest, stay in an apartment of [family Kleiser](http://salenhof.com); they are super-nice hosts and the place is just beautiful. I was very positively surprised that it was not an issue at all for them to let me camp on their grounds for free.

Frost during my first tent night

There was frost in the night and I was cold in spite of three layers of clothing in the sleeping bag – next time I’ll go for five layers ;-)
Shortly after starting the next day, I took a picture of the magnificent outlook onto the Black Forest’s highest peak, Feldberg. When I turned back, there was suddenly another traveler with a bike, equally heavy loaded as me. Denis is between his PhD and a job, quite a similar situation as me, and we even studied in the same place – Aachen. Meaning we already lived in the same city for 1.5 years, but never met. He uses the remaining five weeks, until he will help startups get on their feet, for a cycling trip to Greece. He even started cycling in Freiburg, so it was quite a coincidence how much our routes match. He’s also a hobby photographer, but more involved than I am; he showed me some impressive shots he did in Cambodia. We therefore decided to stay together for half the day, until he would go on to an island in Lake Constance to camp and I would turn straight south to go to Switzerland. This was necessary for me as I had to get out of the country before my German health insurance expired the next day.

Man, dog and horse carriage

On the “Lange Allee”, a forest track that goes straight for 12(!) km, we met a gentleman who was traveling by horse-carriage together with his dog. He told us that he used to ride carriages with four horses in competitions, also against the royal British Windsor family. He’s also a keen racing cycle rider, and related to us that he did most of the high passes in the Alps by bike – impressive to Denis and me, as we both have the one or the other pass ahead on our route.

Going for a swim in Danube

We had our lunch break on the bank of the Danube and went for a short swim before eating. Denis even had an ultralight hammock with him, something every bike traveler should consider to take along! I guess there is nothing like literally hanging around during lunch break. Denis uses [naviki.org](http://naviki.org) for navigating. It seems like a really good navigating solution by bike, because we were mostly driving on little frequented roads.

Bits and pieces of metal in my brake pads

My front rim kept eating brake shoes these days; I will maybe have to replace it in the next bigger town I come along. Funny enough, this will leave the bicycle frame as the only original part left on my bike.

Going to Switzerland in the truck lane

According to my load, I crossed the Swiss border on the track for trucks. Once in Switzerland it was more difficult than expected to find farmers to ask for a place to stay the night. However I came across a site next to a forest trail that looked so obviously like a camping spot that I decided to just go for it. I had no water left to cook rice, so I improvised a new dish: Curry on bread. This night five layers were enough, but there was also no frost.

The next day one look to the sky was sufficient to wake my inner eye; and my inner eye predicted that I would get wet that day. The prophecy came true, and I spent most of the day riding straight, even roads along the banks of the Thur; it felt like going on a highway. The biggest problem was finding a sheltered spot to cook lunch. By the time I settled under the shed of a farmer I was chilled to the bone and direly needed the lunch and afterwards some steep slopes until I had warm feet and hands again. I followed Tatjana’s habit of taking a ridiculous selfie even and because of being very cold, to keep my spirits high. I think I succeeded with the selfie and still have to practice in terms of ridiculousness ;-)

Shortly afterwards, I came across an open store (1st of may is also a holiday in parts of Switzerland) and parked my bike because I was out of bread. Loaded, my bike only reluctantly stands straight without me on top of it, and leaning it on walls it also difficult because the handlebar is wider than the front bags. This store however had a handrail which had its vertical posts in the exact distances needed to get my bike standing on the first attempt. While I was celebrating this great coincidence out in the rain, a passer-by asked me how it was cycling in that weather. We had a short chat and I went inside to do my shopping. While choosing, the passer-by returned and asked me if I wanted to sleep at his place – I gladly accepted and that way got my first warm shower along the way, without even using [warmshowers.org](http://warmshowers.org) ;-) Christian is a globe-trotter and tinkerer with a flat stuffed with tools, a sauna, an old (working!) pinball machine and his dog Sheila. He told me many interesting stories about his trip to Australia and his journey with the Transsibirskaya Magistral from Moscow to Peking, and I cooked us a big pot of Chili con Carne in exchange for his hospitality. He even vacuum-packed me part of it the next morning such that I don’t have to cook when I stop next time. Very nice!

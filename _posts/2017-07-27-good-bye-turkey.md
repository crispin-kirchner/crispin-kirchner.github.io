When I had seen the sign to Iran the day before, I had gone off the straight road leading east, and instead taken a turn north, to the city of Kars. I had gotten the recommendation for this detour from a nice guy in Sofia, Bulgaria, and had anticipated this destination all through Turkey: My way would lead me to Ani, a former Armenian capital, which was now uninhabited since 300 years and lying in ruins.

The street to Kars was scenic. The walls of the deeply cut desert valley through which I rode ended in steep rock formations that reminded me slightly of pictures which I have seen of USA.

Next to the road, there were boulders of an interesting mineral. It was pitch black, yet it seemed to be partly translucent. It looked like black glass, quite the way I imagine [Dragonglass](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass) to look like.

Going uphill later on, I witnessed a strange natural phenomenon: there seemed to be a reversed forest boundary. On the lower levels, there had been no vegetation at all, most likely due to the dry climate. Further up, suddenly conifer forests appeared, and the dusty ground put on a gown of green meadows.

Arriving in Kars the other day, I had to go through the city a lot, in order to get the Dollars I needed in Iran. As it had become habitual now, I drew lots of attention wherever I went, people shouted English phrases at me and I was being gaped at a lot. A youngster on a bicycle played [Chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)) with me, coming straight at me at high speed, turning away in the very last moment. When he afterwards went behind me with too few safety distance, I lost my temper. I stopped the bike out of the blue, such that he would ride into me and fall. The plan worked out, and I got a bad feeling for having been so easy to provoke. The constant attention I got wherever I went was kept gnawing on my nerves.

When I left Kars in the afternoon, I did not expect to arrive Ani the same day. I had strong sidewind, which made it sort of cumbersome to drive, and the road went uphill. However, at the pass the road bent, and so I went downhill *and* had tailwind on the last kilometers to the historical city. Short before arriving, a shepherd boy on a horse stopped me an asked for water. I arrived there at 5pm, seeing the city wall bathed in the warm light of the setting sun.

> ![Most wall paintings are well preserved](/images/IMG_4001.JPG)

The city is located directly next to the Turkish-Armenian border, so it is surrounded to one side by the Turkish border fence. The border river *Akhurian* flows in a deep gorge beneath the city, and the Armenian watchtowers are never out of sight. The wild river, in combination to the ruins at its shores, reminded me of river [Anduin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Anduin), close to the [Argonath](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Argonath) in The Lord of the Rings.

Most of the city consists only of rubble, marking the former walls of the houses. Only few buildings are still erect, mainly the sacral buildings and the wall.

I took my time to enjoy the atmosphere of the ruin city, and camped near the inhabited village of Ani. When I had set up the tent, and was cooking in the dark, I got a visitor: the shepherd boy of the afternoon was herding his cows over the fields, in the light of his smartphone. He sat down opposite of me and watched me cooking. He did not say anything, did not try to communicate, he just sat there and watched me, as if I were an exotic animal in a zoo. He even filmed me with his phone, but luckily stopped it when I asked him to put it down. I was happy that he left when I went inside the tent. However, he came back later to ask for money and cigarettes; When I gave him none of the two he finally left for good. It feels really awkward to be the center of attention everywhere; that's bound to be the way that superstars feel. I am glad as never before in my life to not be famous.

In the tent I was musing on how I would overcome my time problem. I had booked flight back from Tehran at the end of August, and had a visa for Iran which was valid for 30 days. The problem was that if I now went straight for the Iranian border, I would have the hassle of extending the visa just because of some four additional days.

One option I had considered was going through Armenia. As the Turkish-Armenian border is closed, the only way to achieve that would have been to go through Georgia as well, and I was not confident that going through large bits of Caucasus (I have heard that Armenia is never flat) would clash with my schedule. Furthermore, I was not expecting to feel particularly safe, going through a mountain range again, due to my well nourished fear of wild animals.

Looking at the map, Nakhchivan caught my eye. It is an exclave and autonomous region of Azerbaijan, surrounded mainly by Armenia. I needed a visa for it, but it didn't seem to be an issue: It is an e-visa, which I could print out myself, just like a train ticket. No need to go to any embassy. As the review time for the visa was only three days, I applied for it straight from the tent. I looked for a CouchSurfing host in Iǧdır, the last city before the Turkish-Nakhchivan border, to cover the waiting time for the visa.

Leaving Ani, I took a dirt road to the south, to not have to go back to Kars again. The time setting of my cellphone was constantly changing. Due to the proximity to the Armenian border, the received network constantly alternated, and therefore also the time zone.

> ![Dirt road from Ani to Digor](/images/IMG_4062 - IMG_4065.jpg)

I had gotten a couch for the second of the visa-waiting nights in Iǧdır, and was therefore not in a hurry to get there. At a kind of a truck stop I sat down, drank tea and wrote on the blog. While I sat, multiple buses were stopping by, and I had new conversation partners every quarter of an hour.

Getting on the bike again, I could feel to my delight that the air had cooled down, and rolling away from the building, I could feel quite a breeze. The road was descending, and the lower I came, the stronger the winds became. In the end I was having trouble to keep the bicycle on the road. The road was descending in serpentines, and I had to alternate between working hard to not crash into the guardrail, and working hard to not being pushed into the overtaking traffic, depending on which way the road went.

> ![There is a storm coming up](/images/IMG_4075.JPG)

> ![Descending into a gorgeous valley](/images/IMG_4072.JPG)

The road went down into a scenic valley. The air was full of dust, tinted orange by the setting sun, and I could see the outlines of big mountains through the mist. I found a place to camp without any trees nearby, but alas! The wind was raging, and I had a long fight putting up the tent. I was happy, feeling that this was the weather the tent was built for -- until I realized that the three most important anchors were not firm enough in the ground, and kept being pulled out again and again. The wind was rattling the tent walls so badly that I feared it would rip the tent apart. I struggled again, this time to make the tent go back into its bag. Even the short time of being exposed to the storm had contributed to considerably bending the tent rods. Continuing a bit, I realized that there was no way I could build up the tent anywhere close by -- the storm was raging everywhere.

Looking at the map and the wind direction, I had the impression that the storm was blowing straight to Iǧdır. I had the couch only for the next night, but as I saw no other option, I messaged my host whether I could already be his guest for this night. To my delight he replied, and so I refilled my energies with some big chunks of Halva, in order to not collapse on the bike, and went on my way to Iǧdır.

> ![Intense colors on the way to Iǧdır](/images/IMG_4076.JPG)

My theory about the wind direction luckily turned out to be right, and I went to Iǧdır with maddening speed. I covered the missing 55km in two hours. On the way something strange happened: I started dreaming of a cool beer. Very, very unusual for me, I started to ask myself whether something was wrong with me.

Deniz picked me up at the entrance to Iǧdır. I had a shower, and we got a beer each and cracked it together -- I guess one of the beers I enjoyed most in my life. It was an Efes. Afterwards, another thirst I had been carrying with me for far longer was quenched: Deniz had a guitar standing in the corner. I picked it up and played the first song coming to my mind: [Голубой вагон](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chg_TwUjzG4) by the crocodile Gena (I should mention that it is crucial that nobody mastering the Russian language is present when I do that, I'm bound to have a very bad accent and might accidentally insult people due to my lack of knowledge of the language).

The next morning I could feel that I had done two days of cycling on one day -- I was completely done. I did not even manage the way to the kitchen, and so I had my first breakfast on the junkfood scraps which still lay next to my bed from last night. After another half hour of resting, I managed to get up.
We met up for lunch at Deniz' workplace the next day. When I arrived, he was on errands and I managed having a small conversation with his friend at work; after around six weeks in Turkey, I had managed a very basic level of the language. When we went to fetch the Kebab which we had for lunch, I could see mount Ararat in its full grandeur for the first time. As Iǧdır is just 861m above sea level, the mountain rises up more than 4000m above the city, its peak covered in ice -- a very impressive sight.

> ![Mount Ararat](/images/IMG_4078.JPG)

When I had walked over to Deniz' work place, I had had the relieving impression that people were not recognizing me as a tourist when I was without the bike. On the way back I had to realize that this had been a misconception, people were once again shouting and mumbling bits and pieces of English at me.

In the ground floor of Deniz' house there was a bicycle store, where my bike was parked while I stayed there. I dropped by to see whether it was still alright, and asked for new spokes. Unfortunately they only had short, thick spokes instead of the long and thin ones I needed. In the store I met Hüsrev, a Turk who has lived in Germany for two years, and who spoke quite good German. He took me for a walk through the city, and helped as an interpreter while we checked multiple bicycle stores for the needed spoke. I noticed that Iǧdır was quite the bicycle city, it was full of bicycles, all of the same make. Hüsrev told me that they were produced close by.

> ![The Iǧdır bicycle model](/images/IMG_4082.JPG)

He invited me for a tea together with his friend. While we were drinking, I got the confirmation mail that my Azeri visa was ready -- one day early. In the late evening we went out for some delicious waffles and tea. I was reminded of Spanish cities -- the streets were crowded when the sun was down and the temperatures had dropped. In the crowded darkness, people actually did not perceive me as a tourist anymore, much to my pleasure.

This was over the next morning, however -- when I got my bike and started putting on the luggage, I had about 10 spectators standing around me and commenting, until I was finally ready to leave. I stopped by Deniz' workplace once again to say farewell and was seen off very warmly by him and his colleagues.

> ![We did not discuss politics](/images/IMG_4085.JPG)

Out on the road again, a car with a German number plate from Gelsenkirchen passed by. When the driver learned that I was German, he stopped a little bit further on the road, spent me a juice and wanted to hear my story. It was a pleasure to have someone to communicate with properly, without language barrier. Furthermore, it was very pleasant to not have to explain or justify why I was traveling that way -- Europeans are way more used to this style of traveling.

In the last village before entering the narrow tube that is formed by the Armenian and Iranian border, I tried to find a camp spot, which ended in quite a disaster. People understood soon enough that I was looking for a campspot, and I had a company of about twenty cycling villagers of all ages trailing behind me, while my request to camp in a garden was treated quite European -- it was rejected. In the center of the village, the men were sitting together. The alpha male asked without further ado how much my bicycle cost. This question always makes me feel uncomfortable, and I already felt uncomfortable due to my followers and the rejections I had got. I decided to bail out and turned around. As long as it was not in the bounds of someone's ground, I did not want the entire village to know where I camped. Then, one of the youngsters emerged from the pack, telling me to follow him. An older man seemed to not agree with whatever the plan of the youngster was, and got rebuffed fairly aggressively by the youngster. Subsequently, I was led to an abandoned house at the edge of the village. I faked that I was interested in staying there, and the aggressive youngster was drove off the band of children that were still following. When he and his friends did not disappear as well, but had some conversation in which the word "Dollar" fell, I thanked him and used Google Translate to tell him that I did not feel safe sleeping there. Very late, I found a camp spot which was well away from the road, village and the intimidating Armenian border watchtowers. Unfortunately it was a barbecuing spot, so it was guaranteed to be known by the villagers as well.

I felt as unsafe as never on the road, feeling that I would re-encounter the aggressive youngster again during the course of the night, and have some money less to spend in Iran. However, I did not see a good alternative, as it was getting late. I set up tent, ate and went to sleep. I awoke in the night from voices and people stumbling over my tent ropes. I turned on my light, said "Merhaba", and opened the tent flap, looking into the face of a confused man. He was in company of two others, carrying huge backpacks. I said my magic words: "Turist -- bisiklet -- Almanya -- İran", and they set forth their way in the direction of the Armenian border. Confused, I looked after them, until one of the men nervously gestured me to turn off the light. Perhaps the Turkish-Armenian border is not as closed as it seems. 

> ![My campspot in the Armenian-Iranian border tube](/images/IMG_4093.JPG)

The next morning I was relieved that nothing worse had happened. Picking up my food I saw that some animal had worked on it -- the content of the garbage bag was strewn over the ground. I started in the direction of the Nakhchivan border. From what I had researched on the internet, tourists were something completely rare in Nakhchivan, and it started already on the way that people seemed to be particularly confused why I was heading to the border on a bicycle. As it was my last day in Turkey and I was not particularly in a hurry, I even accepted the occasional invitation for a tea, and drank a glass with three construction workers in the shadow of a sign. I put on Reinhard Mey, thought of my family and friends, and was flushed with gratitude for having them.

When I arrived at the border, I handed my ID card and the piece of paper on which the officials had put the Turkish entry stamp weeks ago. They seemed confused, passed the paper from one to the other, made many phone calls, while I waited. Unfortunately I did not wait alone. In a matter of minutes I once again had a cluster of people around me, who kept no distance at all, touching my bicycle, bags, and even me -- one of them fingered my beard. It felt like being surrounded by a bunch of particularly big and nasty midges, only that chasing them off is not an option. Well, I chased off the hand in my beard.

Finally, I was gestured to pass the fence, with an official escorting me into a building of the border complex. We went to an office where some people were waiting. The official in the room made the impression as though he hated his job. He took my ID card and stamp paper, and started shouting something Turkish at me. I was quite relaxed, as I had the Azeri visa, and even if something went wrong, I should have been able to enter Turkey again without problem, and go to the Iranian border instead. The only inconvenience with this option would have been going up 2500m to Doǧubeyazıt. When the official did not calm down, I also handed him my passport and Azeri visa, and I was gestured to sit down and wait. I was tired, but still it was interesting to see the him ranting. Multiple times he picked up my documents to just throw them at his table in an angry gesture. Strange enough, he repeatedly said something about "Hollandalı" -- Dutch people. I had seen a car with a Netherlands number plate pass by earlier -- obviously I was not the only one he blamed for ruining his day. After sitting for an hour, the family from the Netherlands came into the building, and we talked a bit. Then they had to leave, though they did not leave for long: half an hour later they returned. They explained me that they had been rejected at the Nakhcivan border. I asked them whether they could do some interpreting for me, as they also spoke Turkish. The result was quite enlightening. The problem was obviously that I had entered Turkey with the ID card. According to the officer, if he put the exit stamp on the piece of paper where the entry stamp was on, Azerbaijan would not let me enter, as they required the Turkish exit stamp in the passport. However he explained that he was not authorized to put the exit stamp into the passport. He was also not willing to solve it trial-and-error, as he said he could not let me enter Turkey again after he had given me the exit stamp. After some discussion, they came up with driving me over to the Azeri border by car, discussing my case with the officials over there, and if they got the OK from them, I could come back to fetch the bicycle and get over the border. However, this never happened -- I was signaled to sit and wait again. After a total of three hours sitting, something unexpected happened: three officials gathered round my passport, and I witnessed how they put the exit stamp into the passport -- which they before had claimed to be impossible. I shook a lot of hands and said thanks. Even the angry official suddenly smiled. In the end, in spite of being rude, all he had wanted was to make sure that I would be accepted by the Azeri officials at the next border. I sat on my bike to cycle over.

I felt a little bit sad to leave Turkey, after the many good experiences I have had there over such a long time. People welcoming me to their homes, helping me or just giving me things for free all the way. During the border mess I had called my Turkish-American buddy Şafak again, to have him ready in case I should need an emergency interpreter. He found words for how Turkish people had treated and received me during the last weeks: *"You know there is some skepticism between Turkish and German politics these days. But fuck them. Let them do their politics. You are more than welcome here."*

Dear Turkish people, it was a great pleasure to cycle through your country. I am very grateful for this wonderful experience!

# The Tour

My quest until the beginning of October is to cycle from my parent's home to Iran. I mostly do have internet once per day, but don't have the electricity to use the computer. Therefore this blog is only sporadically maintained. If I don't write it doesn't mean I'm in trouble, but rather that I'm staying at a beautiful place in nature.

# The Name

The title of this blog was determined by a fair dice roll on Wikipedia. Gelber Zwerg is German for yellow dwarf. However, it's quite appropriate: People used to worry about my health from time to time due to my yellowish skin color. While most people would not call me a dwarf, the dwarf component reminds me to be humbled by the magnitude of my endeavor, and to not take myself too serious -- after all there are far larger things than me in this universe, which are still labeled as "dwarves", for example [HD 73526](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_73526); and that guy is heavier than our sun.

In this spirit, may the Wei√üer Riese watch my path and protect me from all evil.

Yours, Crispin
